A small number are tied into other Decision Events to ensure they only appear at the correct time, so they will still appear (Garrison Moratto).
    - Changed the terrain to numbers 147 and 498 in hexes 190,13 and 191,12 respectively, as well as changing 191,13 to be a fully land hex, to enable rail traffic to pass to and from Alta in Norway (Scottydawg).
