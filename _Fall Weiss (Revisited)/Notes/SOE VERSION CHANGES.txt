- Reduced the penalty from -0.5 to 0.0 for Defender's HQ (Attacker Losses < Defender Losses (ThisEndUp).
- Dummy Decision 170 added so that the UK's convoy to Arkhangelsk requires the destination and all hexes to Vologda being in Allied hands to fire (The Land).
- All Decision Events (DE 306; 353 and 454) relating to the US sending supplies to the USSR via Persia now require all road hexes between Bandar Abbas and Baku to be in Allied hands (Hobbygeneral).
- The date of Denmark surrendering via DE 601 has been changed from the 14th April to the 3rd April 1940, as have those scripts relating to Norway's surrender if triggered via DE 643 or 644 that would have also taken place on the 14th April (El_Condoro; havoc1371).
- Reduced the chance of the Anglo-French Expedition re DE 204 succeeding from 50% to 33% (scum; gilthib).
- Corrected Soviet Corps and Army Combat Target Statistics (PvtBenjamin).
- Text added to the Strategy Guides to explain that when the US convoy to the UK, or the UK's convoy to the USSR are re-routed, it may be necessary to amend the % being sent by convoy by going to War Maps -> Convoy Map,
  clicking on the relevant flag and using the arrow buttons (EarlyDoors).

1939 Campaign
- French translated text for sending the Anglo-French Expedition to Norway corrected.
- French 2nd Army moved from Verdun to hex 158,83 and given entrenchment level 1 to prevent an exploitative move by the German army at the start of the war (Taifun; Taxman66).
- Reduced USSR bonus UNIT events for the AI at the INTERMEDIATE difficulty level.

1939 and 1940 Campaigns
- Amended the French Strength script for Panic caused by the Maginot Line being outflanked so that it no longer requires Belgium to be Allied, Surrendered. To replace that,
  a check for 2 Axis units being within 3 hexes of Reims has been added (havoc1371).
- Removed the check for Italy's mobilization status from the Decision Events relating to the deployment of the British 7th Armoured (Gilber).
- Allied amphibious preparations against Italy while the USA is neutral may now trigger the deployment of up to 4 Garrison units in mainland Italy and Sicily.

- Dummy Decisions 171 and 172 added to check for an Iraqi unit being in Baghdad in order to trigger an Iraqi surrender to the British (Will952; Scottydawg; Taxman66).
- Iraq now starts at 25% pro-Allied (was 20%) and its convoy to the UK in all campaigns now only requires it to be pro-Allied, so one Axis diplomacy success alone will no longer be enough to end Iraq's convoy to the UK (PvtBenjamin).
- More unit script changes made to ensure the Benghazi DAK can deploy (Taxman66;PvtBenjamin;Will952).

1939; 1940 and 1941 Campaigns

1939 to 1943 Campaigns
- Dummy US Decision DE 371 added to trigger an Italian surrender to the US if Italy's National Morale has fallen below 1%, there is an Allied unit within 15 land hexes of Rome, and there is no German unit in Rome. This is essentially a fall back script to account for rare occasions where Italy may not surrender due to other reasons, generally due to her National Morale plummeting due to multiple scripts firing in a single turn (BigJohn).

1942 Campaign
- The USSR now starts with level 2 in Infantry Weapons and level 1 in Anti-Aircraft Defense; the UK has an additional chit invested in Anti-Submarine Warfare, and the US has an additional chit invested in Production Technology (Taxman66).

1943 Campaign
- The USSR now has level 1 in Anti-Aircraft Defense; the UK now starts with level 3 in Anti-Submarine Warfare but no longer has a chit invested (Taxman66).

v1.21.00

GAME ENGINE CHANGES
- Fixed a controlled unit movement error that led to a CTD when attempting to end the move along several hidden enemy units (EQFL_Sapare).
- Fixed an error that did not properly allow Kamikaze attacks to damage adjacent enemy units.  Normally a Kamikaze attack has a 25% chance of also damaging an adjacent naval unit by 1 strengtg point.
- Fixed an outstanding issue that still did not allow some Free units to upgrade relative to their current controlling major nation (Gilber).
- Fixed an issue where upon surrender, FREE naval units were being bumped out of non surrendering territorial ports (Gilber).
- Fixed an Amphibious Transport error that did not reduce movement action points when the amphibious transport moved adjacent to an enemy capital ship that then attacked it (EQFL_Sapare).
- Fixed a rare CTD that would occur when attempting to place a new unit right at the start of your turn.
- Fixed an issue where Special Forces amphibious transports would auto load into a dead end Land + Sea enemy hex (rocketman71).
- Fixed an error where Subs caught in ice could increase their action points > 1 by switching modes (APrusty).
- Fixed an error where if a Transport unit was selected, the Operational Action buttons would sometimes not be clickable (ruskicanuk).
- Fixed an error that prevented Axis players from being able to shift the Murmansk convoy to Arkhangelsk when cutting off the applicable rail line running from Murmansk to Belomorsk (Aprusty).
- Fixed an error where the game engine would incorrectly move a currently occupied capital to its previous location if liberated.  Now the capital will not move back unless the current capital is also liberated (EQFL_Sapare).
- Purchase screen no longer has a unit pre-selected to help avoid accidental purchases when clicking the Purchase or Production button (rocketman71).
- Mods with zero cost units can now have units upgraded and purchased (stalkerbrumikcz).
- Enemy targets and estimated losses for fully visible units/resources can now be highlighted when selecting a friendly unit to attack via the OPTIONS->ADVANCED settings.
- Units can now be put to sleep for one turn via the Sleep Tool mouse hover and pressing the space bar instead of a left mouse button click (EQFL_Sapare).
- Units set to sleep will now also be skipped by the AI when it is controlling friendly countries and units on your turn (EQFL_Sapare).
	- Left mouse button click will still perform the regular 'sleep' function.
	- Units set to sleep for one turn will have this indicated with a black dot instead of a white dot which indicates regular 'sleep'.
- Naval units can now have a maximum supply that matches the max port strength providing supply, previously naval units were capped at 10 supply even if a port provided 12 supply.  All other naval supply rules remain the same, e.g. a 5 strength port can still provide maximum 10 supply to naval units.
- Air units will now gain maximum supply from any source, so long as they are attached to an HQ (Pocus).
- Supply map overlay will now display any mismatched supply values, e.g. if a unit has less than the overlay value, it will show in brackets in red alongside with the overlay value.
- Improved AI HQ amphibious landings where the AI will actively try and land in a pocket of friendly units and not next to enemy unit positions if possible (Mithrilotter).
- AI scripts can now be accessed in the OPTIONS->ADVANCED->SCRIPTS screen via 'Advanced (AI)' for review as well as to disable any disagreable planning events.
- AI will now consider the belligerence status of a potential Amphibious invasion goal position to avoid potential invasions when not at war with the target position, as applicable to custom mods (wobbleguts).
- HQ supply rules, plus boosting/linking rules recap:
    - HQ units, after amphibiously unloading, start at supply equal to 5 + their current level of Amphibious Warfare technology.  Supply will drop 2 supply points per turn after that.  This allows the HQ to act as a Mulberry for an initial landing until further supply sources are achieved.
    - HQ distribution supply:
           - HQ supply = 0 will have a distribution supply value of 3 (previously it was 5).
           - HQ supply 1 or 2 will have a distribution supply value of 5.
           - HQ supply 3 or 4 will have a distribution supply value of 6 (previously it was 8).
           - HQ supply 5 will have a distribution supply value of 8.
           - HQ supply > 5 will have a distribution supply value of 10.
    - HQ boosting can only be achieved if the first HQ has a supply value >= 3 (previously it was > 0).
           - The HQ to be boosted must have a supply value < 5 and is now automatically increased to a supply value of 5 which caps its distribution supply at 8.
           - This will improve distribution supply for boosted HQs that were at 3 or 4 supply (from 6 to 8), and more importantly, will allow them to 'operate' and 'upgrade' now that they are at 5 supply.
    - LOW SUPPLY HQ boosting can only be achieved if the source HQ has a supply value >= 1 and < 3.
           - The HQ to be boosted must have a supply value < 3 and is now automatically increased to a supply value of 5 which caps its distribution supply at 6.
    - Between two HQs, the higher rated HQ receives the boost, the lower rated HQ is the source of the boost.
    - Source HQs of a supply boost to another HQ are now highlighted with a yellow hex outline, indicating they are the source of the supply boost, when clicking on the recipient HQ.
    - Air units do not receive supply from an HQ unless they are attached.
      - Under supplied Air units, due to not being attached to an HQ, will be indicated by a red hatch beneath the applicable Air unit.
      - Under supplied Air units, attached to an HQ but not to the most optimal supply giving HQ, will be indicated by a purple hatch beneath the applicable Air unit.

EDITOR CHANGES

- Resource scripts added for Algiers; Casablanca; Rabat; Tunis, Bordeaux and Marseille so that they start the war at zero strength, increasing by 1 per Allied turn.

1939 & 1940 Campaigns
- New in game messages and Pop Up Events added to better assist the Allied player on how many units need to be kept in Mediterranean to avoid Italian mobilization.
- While Italy is neutral, Spain will now mobilize 5-7% towards the Axis if there are 2 Allied Amphibious units within 30 hexes of Syracuse Port, or 7 or more Allied naval units within 18 hexes of Syracuse Port, as Franco is concerned at the impact an attack on his former ally will have on his own position.
- Added Soviet Garrison units at Belomorsk and Kandalaksha.
- Corrected the Mobilization_1 scripts for Bulgaria being declared war on by the Axis as they were incorrectly looking for Bulgaria to respond to Turkey to have been declared war upon.

1939, 1940 & 1941 Campaigns
- DE 301 for the US to send tanks to Cairo now checks for El Alamein being in Axis hands, rather than for an Axis unit to be in El Alamein (Big John).

All Campaigns

1939 and 1940 campaigns.
- Territory script #NAME= Germany Annexes Alsace amended so that Metz (160,84) is included (cendrich).
- If Iraq has a pro-Axis leaning then the presence of 1-2 Axis units within 7 hexes of the Suez Canal (210,126) will have a 50% chance per turn of swinging Iraq 25-35% towards the Axis (Mithrilotter).

- User saves versus the AI will now remember the last map position and center on that position when loading the save (John Fireheart).
- Computer spotting range bonuses, as set in the OPTIONS screen, will no longer include extended spotting of Naval Mines (Hotzn).
- HQ supply rules, plus boosting/linking rules recap:
    - HQ units, after amphibiously unloading, start at 10 supply and maintain supply for up to 5 turns with a drop of 2 supply points per turn.
	  This is similar to Special Forces, and allows the HQ to act as a Mulberry for an initial landing until further supply sources are achieved.
    - HQ distribution supply:

- Spying and Intelligence research bonus can now only be negated by a higher value from fully mobilized enemy Major, i.e. pre war USSR cannot negate the German bonus.
- Spying and Intelligence research bonus can now only be decreased by a value from a fully mobilized enemy Major, i.e. pre war USSR cannot decrease the German bonus.
- Spying and Intelligence research bonus for a non mobilized Major, can no longer be affected in any way by a mobilized Major, i.e. Germany cannot decrease a pre war USSR bonus.
- HQ units, after amphibiously unloading, start at 10 supply and maintain supply for up to 5 turns with a drop of 2 supply points per turn.
  This is similar to Special Forces, and allows the HQ to act as a Mulberry for an initial landing until further supply sources are achieved.
- HQ distribution supply has been changed to the following:
       - HQ supply = 0 will have a distribution supply value of 3 (previously it was 5).
       - HQ supply 1 or 2 will have a distribution supply value of 5.

       - HQ supply > 5 will have a distribution supply value of 10.
- HQs (boosting recap) can now only be linked if the first HQ has a supply value >= 3.
       - the HQ to be linked must have a supply value < 5 and is now automatically boosted to a supply value of 5 which caps its distribution supply at 8.
       - this will improve distribution supply for boosted HQs that were at 3 or 4 supply (from 6 to 8), and more importantly, will allow them to 'operate' and 'upgrade' now that they are at 5 supply.
- SUPPLY SCRIPT events such as the Malta Supply Reduction event for Axis resources in North Africa, will require #SOURCE_POSITION units to have a strength >= 5 or the event will not fire.
  Suppression as opposed to outright capture of locations such as Malta will now be possible in order to negate the supply reduction effects.
