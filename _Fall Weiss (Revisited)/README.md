# Fall-Weiss (Revisited)

I take no credit for the original work contained in the Fall Weiss II (June 2023), Strategic Command, War In Europe custom campaign.

The original purpose this repo was solely to facilitate managing changes to the Event and AI scripts in order to address the overwhelming number of grammar, punctuation, event message formatting issues encountered.

However, the project has grown and diverged to the point of it becoming fundamentally different entirely

It has subsequently evolved to also include:
- changes to the scenario core data
    - see [Unit Data](Notes\UnitData.md)
    - various unit name changes
    - introduces Dreadnaught(WWI) ships to the represent the older class of battleships
    - updated initial Finnish deployments
    - overal increase in ship build times
    - updated initial ship deployments, especially Germany / Italy
    - Albania is considered annexed by Italy
    - New ports added to eastern Great Britain
    - changes to the Norway invasion scripts to allow a more random losses inflicted on the Kreigsmarine
    - changes to a number of political events, especially involving Yugoslavia
- a general toning down of new units added via events
- merging / incorporating fixes from the "1939 Storm Across Europe (July 2023) baseline scenario"
- many of the 100% trigger events changed to 90% as some level of randomness is more interesting
- as well as other fixes and enhancements

Although not entirely comprehensive, a more complete list of changes exists here: [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md)
