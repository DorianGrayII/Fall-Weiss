# Fall-Weiss (Revisited)

First of all, this is still a work in progress with an emphasis on:
- historical accuracy;
- while maintaining a sense of balance; and
- enjoyable game-play.

I take no credit for the original work contained in the Fall Weiss II (June 2023), Strategic Command, War In Europe custom campaign.

The original purpose of this project was solely to facilitate managing changes to the Event and AI scripts in order to address the overwhelming number of grammar, punctuation, event message formatting issues encountered.

However, the project has grown and diverged to the point of it becoming fundamentally different entirely.

It has subsequently evolved to also include:
- changes to the scenario core data:
    - introduces Dreadnought(WWI) ships to the represent the older class of Battleships
    - Changes to [Unit Data](Notes\UnitData.md); most notably -
        - Mountain Division stats changed from FWII
        - CLs have a nominal anti-sub rating
        - Dreadnought(WWI) have ratings that put them below a Battleship of WWII
    - various unit name changes
    - updated initial Finnish deployments and force pool
    - overall increase in ship build times
    - updated initial ship deployments, especially Germany / Italy
    - Albania is considered annexed by Italy
        - Tirana now has a base supply of 8
    - New ports added to eastern Great Britain to support historic ship construction launch sites
- changes to the scripting events:
    - changes to the Norway invasion scripts to allow a more random losses inflicted on the Kriegsmarine
    - changes to a number of political events, especially involving Yugoslavia and the Coup
    - a general toning down of new units added via events
    - many of the 100% trigger events changed to 90% as some level of randomness is more interesting
    - a number of the more 'fanciful' events deleted entirely (i.e. Soviets gaining control of the [Dardanelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardanelles))
- fixes:
    - merging / incorporating fixes from the "1939 Storm Across Europe (July 2023) baseline scenario"
    - as well as other fixes and enhancements
