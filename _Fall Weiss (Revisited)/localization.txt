#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_2= Each new level increases Anti-Tank unit's Attack values against Artillery, Light Armor, Tank Units and Anti-Aircraft units by 1 and other ground units by 0.5. Their Defense values against ground units will also increase by 1 against Soft, Light Armor and Tank units, and 0.5 against Hard, Artillery and Strategic Artillery attacks.

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_5= Each new level of Heavy Bomber research improves the Resource Attack values and De-Moralization for Strategic Bomber units. It increases their Defense values by 0.5 against Anti-Air and by 1 against Fighters. It also increases the chance of inflicting damage on a unit occupying a resource 10%.

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_7= Increases the Spotting, Action Points, and Strike Range values by +1 per level for most types of Aircraft and both types of Carriers. For Airships and Maritime Bombers their Naval Spotting ranges increase by +2 per level, while Strategic Bombers Strike Range increases by +2 and Fighters Escort Range by +3 per level.

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_16= Representing investments in training, tactical innovations and doctrine, this category improves the morale of all Infantry type units (Infantry, Cavalry, Paratroop, Special Forces, Engineers, Mountain, Garrison) except Partisans by 10% per level and Mechanized by 5% per level.

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_17= Improves the morale of all Armor/Tank units by 10% per level. Mechanized, Reconnaissance by 5% per level (as they also receive %5 per level from Infantry Warfare).

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_18= Improves the morale of Carriers and Escort Carriers by 5% per level (as they also benefit from 5% per level from Naval Warfare research). Improves morale of all air units, except Airships, by 10% per level.

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_19= Improves the morale of all surface naval units and subs by 10% per level and of Carriers and Escort Carriers by 5% per level (as they also benefit from 5% per level from Aerial Warfare research).

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_21= Improves the morale of all Anti-Tank, Anti-Air, Artillery, Rail Guns, Coastal Guns and Rocket units by 10% per level.  Anti-Air interceptions are also increased by 1 per level.

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_22= This category represents investment in mass Aerial Production capability, and will increase the build limit of Fighters, Medium Bombers by 1 per level and Tac Bombers, Maritime Bombers by 0.5 per level.

#GAME_RESEARCH_MENU_TEXT_23= This category represents investment in mass Tank Production capability, and will increase the build limit of Tank Divisions and Tank Corps by 1 per level achieved.
