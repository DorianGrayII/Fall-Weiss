## France

[List of French Ships of WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Classes_of_French_ships_of_World_War_II)

## United Kingdom

Of course due to reduced industrial capabilites (manpower losses due to engagements), the Royal Navy gradually renounced the costly battleships (only the King George Vs were completed, all others cancelled), and focused instead on aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers and escort vessels.
