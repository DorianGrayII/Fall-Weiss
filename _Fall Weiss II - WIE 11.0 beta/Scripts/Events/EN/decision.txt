<<TAG_1>>= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %NLord Halifax %N%N Although the new French Government has signed an armistice with the enemy and withdrawn from the war, not all French soldiers have given up the fight. %N%N A small number, led by General de Gaulle, intend to continue the struggle from exile as the Free French. %N%N Should we support de Gaulle and through this action offer hope to all those in France, indeed, the whole world, who wish to continue the fight until Europe is free of the evil menace of Nazism? %N%N Supporting the Free French will only cost us 30 MPPs, and it will enable us to prepare operations to prevent the Vichy fleet from falling into Axis hands. %N%N Would you like to support the Free French (YES) or would you rather recognize Vichy France (NO)?
<<TAG_2>>= Supporting The Free French
<<TAG_3>>= If you say (YES) and recognize the Free French, British National Morale will rise 1,000 points and the UK will receive a strength 5 Light Cruiser in Plymouth. %N%N Then, on the 31st May 1943, the UK will receive the full strength Lorraine Battleship at Alexandria. %N%N However, Vichy France, Algeria, Syria and Tunisia will all move 5% towards the Axis. %N%N Saying (NO) and recognizing Vichy France will be seen as a sign of weakness in both Britain and the USA. %N%N It would therefore cause British National Morale to fall by 1,000 points, and the isolationists in the USA would gain ground, swinging the USA 3-5% away from the Allies. %N%N In view of these factors, it is recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_4>>= The UK Recognizes The Free French
<<TAG_5>>= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %NAnthony Eden %N%N Given the threats now facing our convoy routes from around the world, the US Government has offered us some Destroyers in return for bases in the Caribbean and British Guyana. %N%N Although these five Destroyer units will need repairs and fitting out to prepare them for service, their numbers could really help to keep the Atlantic safe for our shipping. %N%N In addition, this evidence of US support for our struggle will boost our National Morale by 1,000 points. %N%N However, by agreeing to this, the transfer of bases will roughly halve our imports from the British Empire and Caribbean. %N%N Shall we agree to the US proposal to swap Destroyers for bases?
<<TAG_6>>= If you say (YES) to this then the UK receives: %N%N a strength 6 DD (Montgomery) at Scapa Flow on the 23rd October 1940 %N a strength 8 DD (Castleton) at Liverpool on the 1st December 1940 %Na strength 6 DD (Lancaster) at Scapa Flow on the 11th January 1941 %N%N Canada receives: %Na strength 8 DD (Annapolis) at St. John's on the 1st March 1941 %Na strength 6 DD (Columbia) at Halifax on the 1st June 1941 %N%N The only downside to saying (YES) to this is that our income from the Caribbean will be reduced, but at least with these Destroyers we will be better able to protect our convoy routes in the Atlantic.
<<TAG_7>>= The UK Swaps Caribbean Bases For US Destroyers
<<TAG_8>>= British Minister Of defense %NHastings Ismay %N%N Our 7th Armoured Division in Egypt is very incomplete, having only about 65 obsolete vehicles, very few of which are combat worthy. %N%N We are currently in the process of completing 150 new tanks that will soon be ready for service, and given the Axis threat to our position in Egypt, it is recommended that these new tanks be sent there to strengthen 7th Armoured. %N%N However, sending these tanks to Egypt will require a heavily armed naval convoy that will cost us 45 MPPs, and the tanks won't arrive there until mid-October 1940. %N%N Would you like to send these tanks to Egypt in order to reinforce 7th Armoured (YES), or would you rather deploy these tanks in the UK for the defense of our home country (NO)?
<<TAG_9>>= Sending 7th Armoured To Egypt
<<TAG_10>>= It is generally best to say (YES) to sending 7th Armoured to Egypt, as it is essential to secure the safety of our position there. The only good reason for saying (NO) would be if the Axis were invading the UK. %N%N The 7th Armoured, known as the 'Desert Rats', saw action in North Africa, Italy and the liberation of North-West Europe, while one Brigade also fought against the Japanese in Burma.
<<TAG_11>>= Office Of The Admiralty %NAlbert Victor Alexander %N%N Many of the supply convoys from our Colonies and Allies pass through the Mediterranean or precariously close to Continental Europe. %N%N The majority of these routes are now under extreme threat, and it is urgently recommended that we re-route these convoys as soon as possible. %N%N While the Admiralty confirms that re-routing the convoys will result in reduced overall tonnage, it is still expected to be far more favorable than to continue convoy sailings within easy range of enemy attack where our losses have the potential to be much greater. %N%N Would you like to re-route the convoys?
<<TAG_12>>= If you say (YES), then our convoy routes from Canada, the USA, the Middle East and Mediterranean will adopt new and safer routes, though we will receive less income from them. %N%N Our convoys that currently cross the Mediterranean would now circumvent the Cape Of Good Hope and arrive in Liverpool, while those from North America would shift upwards nearer Iceland and through the North Atlantic. %N%N If you say (NO), then our convoys will maintain their current routes and income values, but they will run a greater risk of disruption than if we had altered their routes. %N%N If you say (NO) and Malta or Gibraltar are later occupied by the Axis, then there will be a 33% chance per turn of Egypt's convoy ceasing to sail through the Mediterranean. It would then switch to using the longer but safer route to the UK via the Cape of Good Hope. So there may be a delay before this happens.
<<TAG_13>>= The British Empire Amends Its Convoy Routes
<<TAG_14>>= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %NAnthony Eden %N%N Intelligence from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia shows that the regent, Prince Paul, is about to sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis. %N%N If we wish to stop him from doing so then we need to act now, and an opportunity to do so has fortunately presented itself as Prince Paul's nephew, King Peter II, is planning a coup. %N%N Peter II is totally opposed to the Axis and his success will inevitably bring Yugoslavia into conflict with the Axis, and with our help he may be able to increase his armed forces in time to offer significant resistance to the enemy. %N%N Providing officers and equipment to the Yugoslav armed forces will cost 60 MPPs, at 30 MPPs a turn for 2 turns. %N%N Would you like to support Peter II's pro-Allied Coup in Yugoslavia?
<<TAG_15>>= Yugoslavian Support
<<TAG_16>>= If you say (YES) to this then Yugoslavia will join the Allies and it will deploy a half strength HQ to command its armed forces. %N%N Politically, if Greece has not yet entered the war then it will swing 30-40% towards the Allies. Germany will lose 1,000 National Morale points, though it will regain them should Yugoslavia surrender. %N%N If you say (NO), then Yugoslavia will sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis, and Germany will gain 1,000 National Morale points.
<<TAG_17>>= UK Supports A Military Coup In Yugoslavia
<<TAG_18>>= %N%N British War Office %NDavid Margesson %N%N With Axis units having landed in Britain, we must be prepared for the worst and put in place plans for evacuating our Government and continuing the struggle from the Empire. %N%N We could put into place contingency plans to move to either Alexandria in Egypt or Toronto in Canada. %N%N Would you like to prepare to evacuate to Egypt (YES) or Canada (NO)?
<<TAG_19>>= Our convoy routes will automatically adjust to deliver goods to wherever we relocate to. %N%N If it may be possible to launch successful offensives in the Mediterranean then opting for Egypt (YES) might be best, as new units will be able to deploy there. %N%N This will be useful as they will have far less distance to travel before entering combat than had you said (NO) and opted for Canada.
<<TAG_20>>= Churchill Vows To Continue The Fight!
<<TAG_21>>= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %NAnthony Eden %N%N Intelligence reports indicate that Rashid Ali al-Gaylani will attempt to overthrow the pro-British Regent of Iraq, Prince Abdul Illah. Having seized power, Al-Gaylani will then bring Iraq into the Axis camp. %N%N We therefore need to prepare for conflict against a pro-Axis Iraq. The measures we can take include seizing the Port of Basra under the terms of the Anglo-Iraqi Defense Treaty, imposing economic sanctions, and preparing the 10th Indian Corps in Calcutta for service in Iraq. %N%N All these measures together, codenamed Operation Sabine, will cost 140 MPPs, at 35 MPPs a turn for 4 turns. %N%N Would you like to give the order to prepare Operation Sabine so that we will be able to counter a pro-Axis coup in Iraq?
<<TAG_22>>= Cost Of Iraqi Sanctions
<<TAG_23>>= Irrespective of your decision here, Iraq is going to join the Axis. %N%N If you say (YES), then we will be in a much better position to reconquer the country and restore oil production. %N%N Our sanctions will temporarily reduce Axis supply in Baghdad to zero, while our 10th Indian Corps will annex Basra. %N%N Diplomatically, our action against Iraq may make Syria swing 5-8% towards the Axis.
<<TAG_24>>= The UK Imposes Economic Sanctions On Iraq
<<TAG_25>>= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %NLord Halifax %N%N With Italy now in the war our position in Egypt could be severely threatened. %N%N Australia and New Zealand are prepared to rush reinforcements to Cairo, but they will arrive as understrength units requiring some equipment and training to bring them up to full strength. %N%N Alternatively we could let them complete their formation and training in their home countries, in which case they will only deploy for service in Egypt in late 1941. %N%N Would you like to rush these reinforcements to Egypt now as understrength units (YES), or have them form as previously scheduled by late 1941 (NO)?
<<TAG_26>>= If you say (YES), then Commonwealth forces will arrive straight away in Egypt, consisting of a strength 3 New Zealand Corps, and a strength 3 Australian Corps. %N%N If you say (NO), then Commonwealth forces will arrive in Egypt on the 1st September 1941, consisting of a strength 10 New Zealand Corps, and a strength 10 Australian Corps.
<<TAG_27>>= Australia And New Zealand Prepare Rushed Reinforcements For Egypt
<<TAG_28>>= Prime Minister %NWinston Churchill %N%N The Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.) has now been operating since the summer of 1940, but so far it has had little impact. %N%N A report on its activities shows that with more funding S.O.E. could significantly increase the size and scope of its activities. This would enable it to have a much greater impact in supporting and setting up resistance movements throughout occupied Europe. %N%N The cost to put S.O.E. on a sounder footing with the facilities to operate in many occupied countries will be 100MPPs, at 20 MPPs a turn for 5 turns. %N%N Would you like to provide this funding to S.O.E., so that it really can 'Set Europe Ablaze'?
<<TAG_29>>= Funding S.O.E.
<<TAG_30>>= It is strongly recommended to say (YES) to this as doing so will significantly increase the potential of resistance movements throughout Europe to carry out actions against their occupiers. %N%N Through investing in S.O.E. we may also receive periodic reports from resistance groups on Axis dispositions, which could prove useful to Allied strategy. %N%N From January 1944 this investment in S.O.E. may start to bear more fruit, as provided London is in Allied hands, the USA and USSR are both in the war, and there are significant Allied forces near Paris or eastern Poland, then the Axis will face disruption and uprisings in other locations. %N%N See the section on Resistance Movements in the Storm over Europe Strategy Guide for more details.
<<TAG_31>>= British War Office %NDavid Margesson %N%N The Polish Prime Minister in exile, Wladyslaw Sikorski, wishes to form the Polish I Corps to continue the fight against Germany. %N%N The High Command is asking us to spend 50 MPPs, at 25MPPs for 2 turns, to help create and train this new Polish Corps, which will deploy at half strength near London. %N%N Would you like to form the Polish I Corps?
<<TAG_32>>= Polish I Corps
<<TAG_33>>= Given the willingness of the Poles to fight, saying (YES) to this is a cost effective way of increasing our armed forces. %N%N The Polish I Corps was formed in the UK in September 1940. It never reached full strength but its constituent units served well in the liberation of North-West Europe, most famously their 1st Armoured Division at Falaise and its 1st Parachute Independent Brigade at Arnhem.
<<TAG_34>>= British War Office %NSir Percy James Grigg %N%N Following the evacuation of Polish soldiers from the USSR last year, General Wladyslaw Anders has been restoring these men to health, fitness and military efficiency so as to form them into an effective fighting organization. %N%N With their training in Iraq nearing completion, these men are ready to be formed into a new and significant fighting formation. %N%N If you agree, we will form these Polish forces in the Middle East into the Polish II Corps. This Corps will then deploy in Kuwait at strength 8, with 0.5 experience and fully upgraded, for a cost of 75 MPPs, spread over 3 turns. %N%N Would you like to create the Polish II Corps?
<<TAG_35>>= Polish II Corps
<<TAG_36>>= Saying (YES) to this to form the Polish II Corps will increase our strength and make use of the Polish soldiers who were evacuated from the USSR and are now ready for active service again.
<<TAG_37>>= British War Office %NAnthony Eden %N%N There are now tens of thousands of enthusiastic Local Defense Volunteers (L.D.V.) preparing to sell their lives dearly should the Germans invade. %N%N With an investment in training and equipment costing us 35 MPPs, we could turn the L.D.V. into an efficient fighting force capable of taking a heavy toll of any Germans foolish enough to land. %N%N Winston Churchill has also suggested renaming them as the Home Guard. %N%N Would you like to transform the L.D.V. into a Home Guard with better training and equipment?
<<TAG_38>>= The Home Guard
<<TAG_39>>= If you say (YES), then British National Morale will increase by 1,000 points, and should the Home Guard ever deploy in the event of an invasion, they will deploy at strength 6 with 1 experience point. %N%N Whereas if you say (NO), then should the UK be invaded, Local Defense Volunteer units will deploy at strength 5 with no experience. %N%N The difference between both options could make all the difference should the Axis invade, so it is recommended to only say (NO) if you are certain that an invasion won't take place.
<<TAG_40>>= British War Office %NAnthony Eden %N%N Italy has joined the war and her forces in East Africa are invading British Somaliland. %N%N If we do not take steps to reinforce our position in East Africa then the Italians may proceed to invade the Sudan and possibly even Egypt. If they were to act in conjunction with an advance on Egypt from Libya then our situation in the Middle East would become very grave indeed. %N%N Not only our imperial standing but our imports too would be affected. %N%N It is therefore strongly recommended that we spend 60MPPs to strengthen our forces in East Africa. %N%N Would you like to approve this expenditure to secure our position in East Africa?
<<TAG_41>>= East African Campaign
<<TAG_42>>= If you say (YES), then on the 27th November 1941 the defeat of Italian forces in East Africa will be announced. %N%N However, if you say (NO), then Italy will invade the Sudan, and this will cause a small reduction in British National Morale. %N%N In addition, should Axis forces capture Cairo then a half-strength Italian Corps would march north from the Sudan to reinforce the Axis forces in Egypt.
<<TAG_43>>= Combined Operations Headquarters %NAdmiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes %N%N The Germans are enhancing their naval base at St Nazaire for use by U-Boats and possibly surface vessels too. %N%N We could attempt to seriously damage this naval base in a bold strike by packing HMS Campbeltown full of explosives and sending it to St Nazaire. %N%N At St Nazaire it will attempt to explode while wedged in the dock gates, hopefully destroying the port facilities. %N%N At the same time as HMS Campbeltown attacks St Nazaire, commandos will land to disrupt the enemy's defenses. If successful, this operation could prevent the Germans from using St Nazaire for some time to come, possibly permanently. %N%N Would you like to prepare HMS Campbeltown for a raid against St Nazaire for a cost of 20 MPPs?
<<TAG_44>>= Raiding St Nazaire
<<TAG_45>>= If you say (YES), then on the 28th March 1942 the raid on St Nazaire will take place. %N%N This will have a 50% chance of permanently knocking out the port, otherwise the damage inflicted will just be temporary.
<<TAG_46>>= Combined Operations Headquarters %NLord Louis Mountbatten %N%N Our commando units are full of volunteers from all the services, eager for the fight. %N%N There are also men from many other countries who have joined up, including Poles, French, Czechs, Belgians, Dutch, Norwegians, and even some Germans. %N%N If our commandos are to commence operations then they will need some funding for equipment and a proper training camp at Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands. This will cost us 50 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to authorize this expenditure so that our commandos can begin the fight back against the Axis?
<<TAG_47>>= The Commandos
<<TAG_48>>= If you say (YES), then commando raids will start taking place against Axis occupied Europe. %N%N These will target Norway, Belgium, France, and, if Spain is Axis, Coruña. %N%N Royal Marines will also attack Bordeaux in December 1942, representing the raid of the 'Cockleshell Heroes'.
<<TAG_49>>= British War Office %NDavid Margesson %N%N Following the fall of France thousands of Polish soldiers who had sought refuge there in the hope of forming a Polish Army in exile have been arriving in the UK. %N%N Given our now tenuous position both at home and abroad, the British High Command is asking us to spend 50 MPPs, at 25MPPs a turn for 2 turns, to help equip and train these men. %N%N If you agree these soldiers will deploy near London as the Polish I Corps. %N%N Would you like to form this Polish unit?
<<TAG_50>>= Prime Minister %NWinston Churchill %N%N Negotiations are underway with the Portuguese leader, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, to lease the islands of the Azores from Portugal. %N%N Leasing the Azores from Portugal will not only provide us with an extra naval base, but it will also reduce the likelihood of Salazar entering the war against us. %N%N The cost will be 50 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to approve the lease of the Azores from Portugal?
<<TAG_51>>= Leasing The Azores
<<TAG_52>>= If you say (YES), then on the 12th October 1943 the Azores will transfer to UK control, and Portugal will swing 8-12% towards the Allies.
<<TAG_53>>= Prime Minister %NWinston Churchill %N%N Negotiations are underway with the Portuguese leader, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, to lease the islands of the Azores from Portugal. %N%N Leasing the Azores from Portugal will not only provide us with an extra naval base, but it will also improve our relations with Salazar. %N%N The cost of leasing these islands will be 25 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to approve the lease of the Azores from Portugal?
<<TAG_54>>= Prime Minister %NWinston Churchill %N%N The First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, argues that the only way to prevent the French fleet from ever being used against us is to attack and sink it in port. %N%N Some French Battleships could end up in German hands should they conquer Algeria, or were the Vichy authorities to join the Axis. %N%N It is therefore proposed that we launch Operation Catapult to strike at the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir. %N%N Carrying out this attack will cost 35 MPPs, and we must be prepared for a strong diplomatic reaction from the Vichy authorities. %N%N Would you like to launch Operation Catapult to ensure that these French ships can never end up in Axis hands?
<<TAG_55>>= Operation Catapult) then
<<TAG_56>>= %N%N This act would definitely sour relations between us and the new Vichy authorities, but the consequences of not doing so could be far worse, as the presence of the French fleet on the Axis side could possibly tip the war at sea in their favour. %N%N If you say (YES), then the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir will be attacked. %N%N In response, Vichy France and Algeria will move 35-50% towards the Axis, and French bombers based in Algeria will retaliate by bombing Gibraltar. %N%N If you say (NO), then should Vichy Algeria join the Axis, or be conquered by the Axis, then Germany will gain a strength 5 Battleship at Casablanca, and a full strength Battleship at Algiers.
<<TAG_57>>= Prime Minister %NWinston Churchill %N%N It is proposed that we launch an attack on Dakar in French West Africa using Royal Marines and Free French units. %N%N Some of the gold reserves of the French, Belgian and Polish governments are held there, and their capture could prove of significant financial worth. %N%N If successful, General de Gaulle's prestige will increase and our own economic situation could be improved by the capture of the gold reserves. Nevertheless, attacking Dakar could trigger the Vichy authorities in France and North Africa to swing 5-8% towards the Axis. %N%N Preparing an attack on Dakar, codename Operation Menace, will cost us 30 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to launch Operation Menace and raid Dakar?
<<TAG_58>>= Operation Menace
<<TAG_59>>= The raid has only a 20% chance of success, but if successful the UK will receive 200 MPPs representing the capture of gold reserves, and British National Morale will rise by 1,000 points. %N%N If it is unsuccessful then Vichy France, Algeria and Tunisia all have a 20% chance of moving 5-8% towards the Axis.
<<TAG_60>>= Prime Minister %NWinston Churchill %N%N Now that the USSR is in the war, it is more important than ever that we prevent Persia from aligning itself with the Axis, particularly as the Shah refuses to expel German agents known to be operating in his country. %N%N Persia could also prove a useful route for war supplies to reach the USSR from the USA, and this could make all the difference in deciding the outcome of the war. %N%N A joint invasion, launched by British forces advancing from the Persian Gulf in the south, and with the Red Army descending from the north, would overwhelm the country in a very short time, and enable us to divide the country's resources between us. %N%N We propose to offer control of most of Persia to the USSR, while retaining the southern portion which includes the Oilfield at Maidan-I-Naftun and the port of Bandar Mahshahr. %N%N A joint offensive, codename Operation Countenance, would cost both us and the USSR 50 MPPs each. %N%N Would you like to ask Stalin to join us in launching a joint invasion of Persia?
<<TAG_61>>= A joint invasion will ensure that Persia is swiftly conquered, and the economic benefits will more than outweigh the cost. %N%N Saying (YES) to this will also provide the USA with an opportunity to send supplies to the USSR via Persia, and if they do so this will really help the Red Army's war effort.
<<TAG_62>>= Chief of the Imperial General Staff %NField Marshal Sir Alan Brooke %N%N We have some small irregular units serving in North Africa specializing in operations behind enemy lines. These are the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) and David Stirling's Special Air Service (SAS). %N%N The activities of these brave and resourceful men could have a greater impact if they had more equipment, logistical support and the ability to recruit more volunteers. %N%N Providing these units with enough resources to extend their activities will cost 25 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to increase the strength of these irregular forces so that they can make a bigger nuisance of themselves in the enemy's rear?
<<TAG_63>>= Funding the SAS and LRDG
<<TAG_64>>= If you say (YES) to this, then the Long Range Desert Group will provide sporadic reports on enemy activity in Libya and western Egypt, while the SAS will attempt to reduce Axis supply behind enemy lines. %N%N The activities of both bodies will tend to take place fairly close behind the enemy's front line, as they will adjust their operations in accordance with the ebb and flow of battle. %N%N These units will use Siwa Oasis as their base of operations, so the Axis may attempt to capture it in order to prevent their activities. %N%N Should the Axis take Siwa Oasis, then LRDG and SAS operations will cease until such time as the Allies recapture it.
<<TAG_65>>= %NAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief Coastal Command %NSir Philip Joubert de la Ferté %N%N We could improve the safety of our convoy routes by increasing the strength of Coastal Command through deploying a unit of Maritime Bombers at Reykjavik in Iceland. %N%N With a base there, Coastal Command should be able to make a significant step towards closing the Mid-Atlantic Gap, providing air cover over a larger area of the ocean to assist in the Battle of the Atlantic. %N%N Deploying a unit of Maritime Bombers at Reykjavik will cost us 100 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 2 turns. %N%N Would you like to increase Coastal Command's strength by forming this unit in Iceland?
<<TAG_66>>= Coastal Command Iceland
<<TAG_67>>= If you say (YES), then you can use this Maritime Bomber to launch reconnaissance missions against likely U-Boat locations. %N%N It will be best to research and upgrade this unit with Long Range Aircraft so as to extend its strike range. %N%N This unit is in Icelandic service and cannot be Operated for use elsewhere.
<<TAG_68>>= Secretary of State for War %NLeslie Hore-Belisha %N%N Now that we are at war, it is expected of us that we will send a British Expeditionary Force to France, just as we did in the last war. %N%N Arrangements are in place for the B.E.F. to be transported across the Channel and deployed around Rouen on the 1st October 1939. Once there, these forces could provide boosts to French morale, which is rather fragile. %N%N If we do not send the B.E.F. to France then French National Morale will fall by 1,000 points, and the USA will move 5-8% away from the Allies. %N%N Would you like to deploy the B.E.F. in France (YES) or risk the consequences of deploying it in the UK instead (NO)?
<<TAG_69>>= Deploying the B.E.F. in France
<<TAG_70>>= If you say (YES), and it is strongly recommended to do so, then at the start of October the BEF will deploy at Rouen in northern France. It will consist of a strength 5 HQ (Lord Gort), one strength 8 Army, and two strength 5 Corps. %N%N  Once the BEF are in France their presence will provide small boosts to French National Morale. %N%N If you say (NO), then the BEF will deploy at Portsmouth in southern England on the 15th September 1939. %N%N However, by saying (NO), France will be shocked at our lack of support and French National Morale will decrease by 1,000 points. Isolationists in the USA will also make capital out of our lack of desire to defend our French allies, and this will move the USA 5-8% away from the Allies. %N%N If the BEF isn't sent to France but other British units were sent to France before France falls, they could provide bonuses to French morale, but the initial shock to French morale is unlikely to be made good.
<<TAG_71>>= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %NLord Halifax %N%N The First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, is pressing for us to occupy two ports in Ireland to provide the Royal Navy with bases in the coming struggle to protect our shipping from U-Boat attack. %N%N These would be along the south coast of Ireland where until last year we had naval bases in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty signed in 1921. %N%N Ireland lacks the military capability to prevent us from re-occupying the Treaty Ports, but there would be a political reaction against us both there and in the USA were we to do so. %N%N However, as well as being of some strategic benefit, a bold and decisive move like this would boost our National Morale. %N%N Would you like to order the Royal Navy to occupy the ports of Cork and Waterford?
<<TAG_72>>= If you say (YES), then the ports of Waterford and Cork will switch to our control for the use of our ships, though they would return to Irish control should Ireland enter the war. %N%N The political reaction in Ireland of doing this will move it 10-15% towards the Axis, and the USA will also move between 4-6% away from the Allies. %N%N On the other hand, this decisive action will increase British National Morale by 1,000 points, and the use of these ports will certainly be useful later on.
<<TAG_73>>= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %NAnthony Eden %N%N The Prime Minister is pressing once again for us to occupy an Irish port. This time he recommends the port of Limerick on the west coast of Ireland. %N%N It is certainly true that using this port could be very useful, but doing so would also cause a strong reaction in Ireland against us. Unlike with the Treaty ports, we have had no claim whatsoever to this port since the civil war ended in 1921. %N%N Occupying Limerick will only cost us 25 MPPs, though it will trigger a reaction against us in both Ireland and the USA. %N%N This port could be of significant use, and our bold and decisive action would improve our National Morale by 1,000 points. %N%N Would you like to order the Royal Navy to occupy the port of Limerick?
<<TAG_74>>= Occupying The Port Of Limerick
<<TAG_75>>= If you say (YES), then the port of Limerick will switch to our control for the use of our ships, though it would return to Irish control should Ireland enter the war. %N%N The political reaction in Ireland would move it 18-25% towards the Axis, and the USA would also move between 4-6% away from the Allies. %N%N Nevertheless, this decisive action will increase British National Morale by 1,000 points, as it will show that our government means business.
<<TAG_76>>= First Lord of the Admiralty %NWinston Churchill %N%N The German occupation of Denmark presents us with a problem, as if the Germans are given the opportunity to use Iceland as a naval base then our convoys could become extremely vulnerable to attack. %N%N It is therefore strongly recommended that we send an expedition to Iceland to prevent its use by the enemy. %N%N This mission, codenamed Operation Fork, will cost 25 MPPs. It will not consist of any significant troop numbers as only a small number of Royal Marines are available. %N%N So while this expedition could not prevent a properly organized enemy invasion, it will be in sufficient strength to secure the island. %N%N Would you like to order the occupation of Iceland?
<<TAG_77>>= Occupying Iceland
<<TAG_78>>= %N%N Saying (YES) to this will place Iceland under our control, though with no troops in it. %N%N Reykjavik could then be put to good use as an air and naval base to assist us in the Battle of the Atlantic, and in January 1942 we will have the opportunity to deploy a unit of Maritime Bombers here.
<<TAG_79>>= First Lord of the Admiralty %NWinston Churchill %N%N The expedition we sent to Finland has returned, and the troops are now arriving at Inverness in Scotland where they are being deployed as a strength 8 Special Forces unit. %N%N It might be worthwhile sending them to Narvik in Norway to retake the town from the Germans before they are able to fully establish themselves there. This will only cost 10 MPPs, and if Narvik is liberated then our National Morale will receive a 500 point boost. %N%N Being a Special Forces unit they could evacuate by sea without requiring a port should the expedition prove unsuccessful. %N%N If you don't wish to send this unit to Norway then it will remain at Inverness for service elsewhere. %N%N Would you like to send this force, codenamed Rupertforce, to attempt to retake Narvik?
<<TAG_80>>= Norwegian Expedition
<<TAG_81>>= This mission has a fairly low probability of success, and none at all if the French don't also send a force to Narvik. %N%N Providing some naval support is recommended, particularly some Carriers to launch air strikes against the German forces defending Narvik. %N%N But even so, it will not be easy to take and hold Narvik.

<<TAG_83>>= Finnish Expedition
<<TAG_84>>= Operation Countenance
<<TAG_85>>= Prime Minister %NEdouard Daladier %N%N Thousands of Polish soldiers who have escaped from Poland are arriving in France as they wish to carry on the struggle against Germany. %N%N Just as we formed a Polish Army in France in 1918, the new Polish Prime Minister, Wladyslaw Sikorski, asks that we do the same again today. He therefore asks permission to form the Polish I Corps on our soil. %N%N It will cost us 50 MPPs, at 25MPPs for 2 turns, and this new Polish Corps will be formed at Le Mans to the south west of Paris. %N%N Would you like to give permission to the formation of the Polish I Corps?
<<TAG_86>>= Forming this Polish Corps will increase our ability to defend France, so it is recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_87>>= Foreign Minister %N%N Following the success of Operation Overlord, General de Gaulle has proclaimed the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) to be the new Government of France. %N%N It is recommended that we now reincorporate Vichy France and pursue the remaining leaders and supporters of Vichy France for trial on the grounds of treason. %N%N Would you like to reincorporate Vichy France into France proper?
<<TAG_88>>= It can only be right for the victorious Allies to say (YES) to this and reunite France. %N%N However, if Vichy France has any armed forces in the field then these will be lost in the process, so bear this in mind before deciding.
<<TAG_89>>= Prime Minister %NEdouard Daladier %N%N The French Communist Party has denounced the war as an Imperialist conflict, and their deputies have called for us to make peace with Hitler. %N%N If we aren't careful then Communist influence in the army will grow. This would lead to disaffection and disruption which would reduce the efficiency of our armed forces. %N%N It is therefore recommended that we act decisively to ban the party and arrest its militants. If we do so we will prevent disaffection in the army and our National Morale will increase by 1,000 points. %N%N The USSR would see this as a hostile move and could be expected to swing 3-5% away from us. %N%N Would you like to ban the French Communist Party and detain its militants?
<<TAG_90>>= The French Communist Party was significantly weakened by the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939, as many militants struggled to understand why the USSR had aligned itself with Germany. %N%N Taking advantage of this situation, the French government decided to act decisively in banning the Communist Party to prevent the spread of subversive anti-war propaganda. %N%N By saying (YES) to this, France may be able to hold out a little longer, though at the expense of slightly delaying the USSR's entrance into the war.
<<TAG_91>>= France Bans The Communist Party And Arrests Thousands Of Militants
<<TAG_92>>= Prime Minister %NEdouard Daladier %N%N There are tens of thousands of Spanish Republicans living in internment camps in the south of France. %N%N Some of these have already enlisted in the Foreign Legion, but we could make use of many more by using them to assist in the work of improving our fortifications. %N%N Although many of these exiles are political undesirables, putting them to work would enable us to get some use out of them, while also helping improve our country's defenses. %N%N At a cost of 50 MPPs, from the men held in the internment camps we could raise a half strength Engineer unit at Perpignan in the south west. It would then need to be moved to the north so that it could commence work on constructing fortifications facing possible German lines of advance. %N%N Would you like to authorize the recruitment of Spanish Republicans to serve as Engineers?
<<TAG_93>>= Forming an Engineer Unit
<<TAG_94>>= France made use of the large number of Spanish Republican exiles who were living in camps in southern France, enlisting them in labour battalions to improve their defenses. %N%N By saying (YES) to this, France may be able to construct a fortification in time to be of use against Axis invaders, maybe more if the enemy offensive stalls. %N%N It will be best to Operate it from southern France to a suitable place for it to set to work, such as near Paris. %N%N If all else fails then this unit can at least serve a role in plugging a hole in the line, so it would be wise to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_95>>= Prime Minister %NEdouard Daladier %N%N General Weygand proposes that together with the British we send a military expedition to Finland to enable them to resist the Red Army. %N%N If we do assist the Finns, the British will be obliged to follow suit, as British public opinion and their First Sea Lord, Winston Churchill, are strongly in favour of doing so. %N%N For a cost of 150 MPPs, to be shared evenly between Britain and France, this support could halt the Soviet dictator's aggression in the Baltic. %N%N However, given the logistics involved this mission only has a 50% chance of success. Yet whether successful or not, the units comprising the expedition will return to Scotland in early April 1940. %N%N Would you like to send a joint Anglo-French Expedition to Finland?
<<TAG_96>>= The expedition has a 33% chance of reaching Finland in time to provide them with enough support to withstand the Soviet onslaught. If successful, the USSR will not gain any Finnish territory as a result of the conflict, and the USSR will move 8-12% towards the Axis. %N%N For their decisive action in helping defeat aggression against a neutral country, France and the UK will both gain 500 National Morale points, and Finland will swing 25-35% towards the Allies. This will give Finland a pro-Allied leaning, virtually guaranteeing her neutrality for the foreseeable future. %N%N If the mission doesn't arrive in time then Finland will be forced to cede territory to the USSR in March 1940. %N%N Whether successful or not, the Anglo-French expedition will return to Scotland at the start of April 1940, with a French strength 8 Special Forces unit of Chasseurs Alpins deploying at Dundee with Full Research, while a similar British unit (called Rupertforce) will deploy at Inverness. %N%N If Germany invades Norway via DE 643 or DE 644 then the Allies will have an opportunity to send these units to Narvik to attempt to recapture the town. This opportunity will not exist if this expedition is not sent, so it is recommended to do so by saying (YES).
<<TAG_97>>= Prime Minister %N%N The expedition we sent to Finland has returned, and the troops are now arriving in Scotland. %N%N Comprising a strength 8 Special Forces unit, for a cost of only 10 MPPs these soldiers could be sent to Narvik in Norway to attempt to liberate the town. %N%N If we are successful then our National Morale will receive a 500 point boost, and preventing the Germans from using the port would be of long term benefit in the war. %N%N The good thing about it being a Special Forces unit is that should the expedition prove unsuccessful then it could evacuate by sea without requiring a port. %N%N If you don't wish to send this unit to Norway then it will remain at Dundee for service elsewhere. %N%N Would you like to send an expedition to attempt to retake Narvik (YES) or leave it at Dundee (NO)?
<<TAG_98>>= This mission has a fairly low probability of success, and none at all if the UK doesn't also send a force to Narvik. %N%N Providing some naval support is recommended, particularly some Carriers to launch air strikes against the German forces defending Narvik. %N%N But even so, it will not be easy to take and hold Narvik.
<<TAG_99>>= Funds to Reform the French Army
<<TAG_100>>= Office Of The Secretary Of State %NCordell Hull %N%N Axis successes in North Africa pose a serious threat to the Suez Canal and the whole of the Middle-East. %N%N The fall of Egypt could have catastrophic consequences, so to help avoid this we could send an urgent delivery of tanks to Cairo in order to help reinforce and re-equip the British forces serving in Egypt. %N%N Doing this would cost us 200 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 4 turns, though there is a small chance of neutrals reacting against what will be a fairly open intervention in the war. %N%N Would you like to supply the British army in Egypt with US armor?
<<TAG_101>>= Sending A Tank unit To Egypt
<<TAG_102>>= %N%N Winston Churchill called on the USA to send an urgent supply of tanks to Egypt when it was seriously threatened in 1942. %N%N The US authorities responded promptly, dispatching 300 new Sherman tanks and 100 self propelled guns. %N%N Given that much of the US army lacked modern equipment at this time, this was a generous move, one that helped to swing the balance towards the Allies in the Desert. %N%N If you say (YES) to this, there is a 75% chance of Turkey swinging 8-15% towards the Axis. %N%N Even so, saying (YES) to this is recommended if your position in Egypt feels at all threatened.
<<TAG_103>>= The US Sends An Emergency Supply Of Tanks To Egypt
<<TAG_104>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N Some important aircraft orders that had been placed in our country by the French Government are nearing completion. %N%N Obviously they cannot be delivered to France now that it has fallen, so we can either use them to supply much-needed aircraft to the UK and Canada, or we can use them to equip our own air force. %N%N If we give them to the UK and Canada, then the UK will receive a Tactical Bomber unit, and Canada a Maritime Bomber unit. Delivering them will cost us 25MPPs. %N%N If we keep them, then we will receive a Tactical Bomber and a Medium Bomber unit. %N%N Would you like to send these aircraft to the UK and Canada (YES) or retain them for our own use (NO)?
<<TAG_105>>= Aircraft Delivery
<<TAG_106>>= With the fall of France, the UK took over the majority of French orders for aircraft and machine tools. %N%N Saying (YES) to this is a good way to rapidly increase British and Canadian air strength, and the US should be able to replace the delivered aircraft quickly once her war economy starts to reach its full potential.
<<TAG_107>>= US Sends French Aircraft Orders To Canada And The UK
<<TAG_108>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N Brazil is willing to join us in the war in Europe and has offered to send an Expeditionary Force that will deploy shortly at Norfolk in the USA, from where we will need to ship it to Europe. %N%N However, Brazil requires our assistance in preparing this Corps for combat, so as to bring it up to full strength with the best equipment available. Doing so will cost us 40 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to say (YES) to this expenditure to ensure that the Brazilian Expeditionary Force is able to take the field at full strength? %N%N Otherwise if we say (NO), then this Brazilian formation will deploy at half strength with obsolete equipment.
<<TAG_109>>= Equipping The Brazilian Corps
<<TAG_110>>= Having entered the war in 1942, it wasn't until 1944 that the 25,000 strong Brazilian Expeditionary Force was sent to serve in Europe. %N%N Given US equipment and serving under US command, this Brazilian force was the only armed unit from South America to see action in World War II. %N%N It is recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_111>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N With France and the Soviet Union having surrendered and Britain having lost Egypt, it is now felt that continuation of the war will only delay the inevitable. %N%N On behalf of our Allies it is suggested that we offer an unconditional cessation of hostilities to the Axis powers. %N%N Should the Axis accept, the war will now be over. %N%N Would you like to end the war and make peace with the Axis powers?
<<TAG_112>>= If you say (YES), then Germany is presented with peace terms, and if they agree too then the game will end as an Axis Major Victory. %N%N If you don't think that you can turn the game around, and would rather start again than continue on to the bitter end, then say (YES) to this. %N%N Hopefully you'll have better luck in your next game!
<<TAG_113>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N Now that the USSR has entered the war, we could assist her in her struggle by shipping supplies through the Pacific to Vladivostock in the Far East. %N%N These supplies will sail under a Soviet flag and sending them this way is far safer than through the Atlantic. %N%N Given the difficult situation facing the USSR, these goods are worth far more to the Soviet Union than they are to us. Therefore the cost of sending these supplies is only 40 MPPs, while they will be worth 80 MPPs a turn to the USSR. %N%N Would you like to send supplies to the USSR through the Pacific?
<<TAG_114>>= The USA started shipping supplies to the USSR via Vladivostock from June 1941, and it is strongly recommended to say (YES) to this to boost the Soviet Union's ability to defend itself.
<<TAG_115>>= US Supply Ships Set Sail For Vladivostock In The Pacific
<<TAG_116>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N As we find ourselves more and more drawn to the Allies, one thing we could do to assist the British in their struggle would be to allow their ships access to one of our ports. %N%N The port of Providence to the east of New York appears the most suitable. %N%N Of course, should we enter the war then the port would automatically return to our control. %N%N Would you like to assist the British by granting them permission to dock their ships at Providence?
<<TAG_117>>= British ships were allowed access to US ports as the USA slowly found itself drawn towards entering the conflict as the Battle of the Atlantic took its toll of merchant shipping. %N%N Saying (YES) to this will cost us nothing, and it will allow British ships protecting Atlantic convoys to refuel and carry out some repairs without having to return to either Canada or their homeland. %N%N So this is a good way of supporting our Allies while maintaining our neutrality.
<<TAG_118>>= The US Gives Britain Permission To Repair And Refuel Ships In The USA
<<TAG_119>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N With Persia now in Allied hands, we could make use of the country to send supplies to the USSR. %N%N For a cost to us of only 40 MPPs a turn, the goods we send via Persia would be worth 80 MPPs to the USSR. Their arrival would also boost Soviet National Morale by 200 points a turn. %N%N The increased benefit of these goods to the USSR is due to their much greater scarcity value there. So sending war supplies and food this way will be extremely useful to the Soviet Union. %N%N Would you like to send supplies to the USSR via Persia?
<<TAG_120>>= Following the conquest of Persia, the US sent huge amounts of war material to the USSR through the country. %N%N Given the economic worth to the USSR of doing so, you are very strongly advised to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_121>>= The US Sends Supplies To The USSR Via Persia
<<TAG_122>>= President of the United States %NFranklin D. Roosevelt %N%N We could relieve the British of the need to worry about protecting Iceland by sending the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade there from San Diego. %N%N With your approval, they could arrive in Reykjavik at the end of the first week in July. %N%N Doing so would only cost us 25 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to send the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to Reykjavik?
<<TAG_123>>= Deploying US Marines in Iceland
<<TAG_124>>= In June 1941 Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, proposed sending a Brigade of US Marines to relieve the British garrison in Iceland. They arrived there on the 7th July 1941 and the British forces left for service elsewhere. %N%N With our Marines deployed in Iceland, any Axis invasion will have to fight these men, and this could serve our political aims as attacks on our troops would galvanize American opinion for war. %N%N Take note that while our country is neutral we would not be able to move this Garrison unit from Reykjavik, nor reinforce it. Our Marines' role would be purely stationary to prevent an Axis landing from capturing the country unopposed.
<<TAG_125>>= President Roosevelt Approves The US-Icelandic Defense Agreement
<<TAG_126>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N Bill Donovan's Office of Strategic Services proposes to extend its network of agents in Vichy Algeria, to suborn local officials, both military and civilian, in order to pave the way for a US landing in the country. %N%N For a cost of 25 MPPs, O.S.S. believe that these agents could carry out minor uprisings in our favour should American forces land at either Casablanca, Oran or Algiers. %N%N Would you like to authorize O.S.S. to intrigue in this manner in Vichy Algeria?
<<TAG_127>>= O.S.S. Activity in Algeria
<<TAG_128>>= While any risings by pro-Allied forces in Vichy Algeria could only weaken rather than eliminate enemy resistance, they could be very useful if we were to land American soldiers in Algeria. %N%N If you say (YES), then risings will occur when American troops land in Algeria. %N%N These risings would occur whether Algeria joins the Axis, or we declare war on her. %N%N Before Operation Torch, the US built up a large network of Allied sympathizers within Vichy territories as they hoped to use them to minimize losses in any operations in Vichy territory.
<<TAG_129>>= Office of the Secretary of War %NHenry L. Stimson %N%N The Office of Strategic Services has some contact with Spanish Republicans that could be made use of to increase the latter's ability to harm Franco's war effort. %N%N For a cost of 50 MPPs, O.S.S. will provide money, arms and communications equipment to selected Republican guerrilla groups, avoiding Communists where possible. %N%N They will also attempt to co-ordinate activities so that the guerrillas will have a far bigger impact than they are currently having. %N%N Would you like to authorize O.S.S. to build on their links with the Spanish Republican Resistance so that they can launch attacks to damage the Spanish war economy?
<<TAG_130>>= Spanish Republican Resistance
<<TAG_131>>= The Spanish Civil War ended in April 1939 with the victory of Franco's Nationalists and the defeat of his Republican opponents. But many Republicans still hoped to overthrow Franco and resistance networks were active in the country throughout the 1940s. %N%N O.S.S. did have some links with the resistance in Spain, and it is likely that they would have expanded their activities there had the war extended to Spain. %N%N By saying (YES) to this, Spanish Republicans will be able to launch sporadic actions to disrupt income at the mines in Gijón, and to a lesser extent in Granada, Córdoba and the mines in Sabadell near Barcelona. %N%N In the long run this should prove to be a good way of hitting Axis income.
<<TAG_132>>= Supplies To USSR (Worth Double To USSR)
<<TAG_133>>= Supplies To USSR Via Persia (Worth Double To USSR)
<<TAG_134>>= Red Army Headquarters %NNorth-West Theater %N%N Generals Karol Swierczewski and Stanislav Poplavsky inform us that the People's Army of Poland is prepared to recruit and train more men to fight alongside the Red Army. %N%N With our help the Polish First and Second Armies will be formed near Minsk for a cost of 150 MPPs, %Nat 25 MPPs a turn for 6 turns. %N%N Would you like to form the Polish First and Second Armies?
<<TAG_135>>= Polish First and Second Armies
<<TAG_136>>= In 1944 the I Polish Corps was expanded to form the Polish First Army and command of this formation was given to General Zygmunt Berling. %N%N As the Red Army advanced west, a Polish Second Army was formed under the command of Karol Swierczewski. %N%N Both armies saw much action from the summer of 1944 onwards, and both took part in the Battle of Berlin in 1945. %N%N This is a way cheap way to raise more units, so it is probably best to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_137>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N In order to decrease Leningrad's vulnerability to attack from the north, and to weaken the Finnish army, it is suggested that we force Finland to hand over some territory to us. %N%N We can demand the Karelian Isthmus (the area north of Leningrad) and the port of Hanko to the west of Helsinki. %N%N Would you like to force Finland to transfer the Karelian Isthmus and Hanko to our control?
<<TAG_138>>= Though our relationship with both the Allies and Sweden will suffer slightly by doing this, it will not cost us anything, and if we are successful the territory should become ours in early 1940. %N%N The only thing that could prevent us succeeding against Finland would be if an Anglo-French Expedition were to arrive in time to support the Finns. %N%N By saying (YES), should Finland later join the Axis then some of her units will start at half-strength, rather than full strength, though with one experience point rather than just half a point. %N%N We will later have an opportunity to prepare the Red Army for winter warfare, and if you say (YES) to attacking Finland then the lessons learned from fighting the Finns will reduce the cost at that time of preparing our soldiers for winter warfare.
<<TAG_139>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N The enemy's advance is threatening our industrial resources in the Ukraine, and without these resources the war could soon be lost. %N%N It is therefore vital that we transfer technicians and machinery to the Urals where new factories can be built to continue the war effort. %N%N Doing so will temporarily disrupt production in the Ukraine, but in the long run the benefit will far outweigh the cost. %N%N Would you like to authorize the transfer of industrial resources to safety in the Urals?
<<TAG_140>>= The transfer of industrial facilities from the Ukraine to the Urals was vital in enabling the USSR to withstand the Axis onslaught. %N%N It cannot be stressed enough just how important it is to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_141>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N The British have proposed that we join them in invading Persia to overthrow the pro-Axis Shah. %N%N Their plan is that we then divide the country between us, with the British having the Oilfield at Maidan-I-Naftun and the port of Bandar Mahshahr. %N%N The invasion would only cost 100 MPPs, to be divided equally between both countries. %N%N Would you like to approve this British plan to invade Persia and divide the country between us?
<<TAG_142>>= A joint invasion will ensure that Persia is swiftly conquered, and the economic benefits will more than outweigh the cost. %N%N Saying (YES) to this will also provide the USA with the opportunity to send supplies via Persia to sustain our war effort. The conquest of Persia is essential if we wish the US to send us supplies through this country, so it is recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_143>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N The Finns have come to realize that the Axis are losing the war, and are making peace overtures to us. %N%N They offer an immediate cessation of hostilities, and if we accept them then we will be able to concentrate fully on our advances into Germany and the Balkans. %N%N Would you like to sign an armistice with Finland?
<<TAG_144>>= While the Germans could take countermeasures to keep Finland in the war, if they don't then we will have peace once again on our northern flank. %N%N Another bonus from this is that with Finland out of the war, Germany will automatically lose 2,000 National Morale points. %N%N The alternative of not accepting an armistice with Finland would mean that we would have to conquer the country to remove it from the war.
<<TAG_145>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N General Anders has turned down our offer to evacuate thousands of Polish soldiers from the USSR. %N%N It would therefore seem appropriate that we enlist these men into the Red Army, to form them into a Polish Corps at Kuybyshev. %N%N This could be done for a cost of 75 MPPs, at 25 MPPs a turn for 3 turns. This Polish Corps will then deploy at strength 8, with no experience due to the poor health of the men, and it will require upgrading. %N%N Would you like to form the I Polish Corps as an integral part of the Red Army?
<<TAG_146>>= I Polish Corps
<<TAG_147>>= If General Anders hadn't evacuated Polish soldiers and civilians from the USSR to the Middle East then it is likely that more would have taken the field in the USSR.
<<TAG_148>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N Now that the German invasion of Poland is well underway, it is important that we do not show weakness and let the Germans gain the whole country. %N%N It is therefore important that we fulfill our side of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by marching into Poland, even though it will cause some slight harm to our relationship with the UK and France. %N%N Would you like to order the Red Army to prepare to advance into Poland?
<<TAG_149>>= This decision will play a key role in determining the boundaries between Germany and the USSR after Poland has fallen, and if we do not advance into Poland then the Germans will have a good starting point from which to invade the USSR. %N%N Given our current poor state of readiness for war, saying (NO) could put us in a very compromising situation. %N%N Saying (YES) and advancing into Poland will also provide us with the possibility of increasing our income by capturing Lwow, and by holding the fortress of Brest-Litovsk we will be able to slow the German invasion that is bound to come within the next few years. %N%N Note that even if we do say (YES) to this and invade, it is possible that the Germans will refuse to honor the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and force us to withdraw from Poland. %N%N Designer's Note: this advance is fully handled by the engine, so it is neither possible nor required to manually move any Red Army forces into Poland.
<<TAG_150>>= %N%N Red Army Headquarters %N%N With the enemy advancing into the Motherland, it might be wise to take steps to instil harsh discipline in the army to increase our soldiers' fighting spirit and prevent desertions. %N%N At the same time, we should increase the size of the NKVD to ensure that justice is meted out on any who disobey orders and desert. %N%N Imposing discipline in the Red Army will cost us 25 MPPs and will provide our forces with a one time morale boost of 25%. %N%N Would you like to say (YES) to imposing harsh discipline to increase the Red Army's efficiency in its struggle to halt the enemy's advance?
<<TAG_151>>= Improving Discipline In The Army
<<TAG_152>>= The staggering advance of Axis forces into the USSR in 1941 led to extreme measures being introduced to improve discipline and reduce desertion. %N%N Order 270 was issued to impose severe punishments for desertion, being read aloud to Red Army soldiers by the Commissars, while the NKVD was strengthened to ensure that orders were carried out.
<<TAG_153>>= Stalin Issues Order 270 And Enlarges The NKVD To Impose Discipline In The Red Army
<<TAG_154>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N Comrade Stalin, the invaders are approaching our capital and the people require inspiration to increase their dedication to resist. %N%N If you were to announce that you will stay in Moscow to lead its defense, then our workers and soldiers will take heart from your example and redouble their efforts to blunt the enemy's offensive. %N%N Nevertheless, it is only recommended that you say (YES) to announcing that you are leading Moscow's defense if you are confident of being able to prevent the enemy from taking the city. %N%N The danger is that if you tie your name in to the defense of the city and it is lost, the effect on morale will be very grave indeed. %N%N Given this risk, would you like to show a bold face to the world and announce that you will stay in Moscow?
<<TAG_155>>= Saying (YES) to this will provide a temporary boost of 25% to all our forces' morale, and it will also increase our National Morale by 5,000 points. %N%N Together these boosts will help to reduce the chance of the enemy taking Moscow. %N%N However, should the enemy subsequently take Moscow then our troops will suffer a one-off unit morale penalty of 40%, coupled with a loss of 12,500 National Morale points. %N%N This would be all the greater than it would have been had you said (NO), as by saying (YES) to this, Comrade Stalin is staking his reputation on holding Moscow. %N%N Whereas if you say (NO) to this and Moscow falls, our National Morale will only fall by 5,000 points. %N%N So if you think that the fall of Moscow is inevitable it will be better to say (NO). %N%N If you're prepared to make a fight of it, then say (YES).
<<TAG_156>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N Following our conflict with Finland, it has become apparent that our soldiers are under equipped for winter warfare, and as a result they suffered significant losses. %N%N Given that war with the Axis powers is virtually inevitable, it would be useful for us to take advantage of our recent experiences to better prepare the Red Army for winter warfare. %N%N If we set a process in motion now, we could provide winter clothing and equipment to our forces for just 50 MPPs. %N%N Through this investment we will avoid suffering unduly from sicknesses during the winter when we are next at war. %N%N Would you like to prepare the Red Army to fight more effectively during the winter?
<<TAG_157>>= Providing Winter Equipment
<<TAG_158>>= The Red Army did learn the lessons of the Winter War and so was better able to survive the winter campaigns of the Great Patriotic War, but it was only through investing in the army's equipment that this was the case. %N%N It is strongly recommended to say (YES) to this, as that will give your forces an edge over Axis units during the first winter of the coming conflict.
<<TAG_159>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N Discussions have taken place with some senior German Prisoners of War who state that they are willing to serve us in the fight against the Axis. %N%N They propose forming a body called the National Committee For A Free Germany to make propaganda to lower enemy morale. %N%N Setting up this organization will only cost us 25 MPPs, and its effect will be to provide a 500 point boost to Soviet National Morale, and a more significant penalty of 1,000 points against Germany. %N%N Would you like to authorize the formation of this committee to carry out propaganda aimed at the enemy?
<<TAG_160>>= Forming a National Committee For A Free Germany
<<TAG_161>>= The most important of the German officers who switched sides were General der Artillerie Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach, and the fighter pilot Heinrich Graf von Einsiedel, a great grandson of Chancellor Bismarck. %N%N Later, after his surrender at Stalingrad, Field Marshal Friedrich von Paulus joined the organization. %N%N The National Committee For A Free Germany had its own newspaper, Freies Deutschland, and a radio station for broadcasting propaganda, while some members were used to interrogate German prisoners.
<<TAG_162>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N An internal study shows that our forces are ill equipped for winter warfare, and will probably suffer significant losses if engaged in combat during the winter. %N%N Given that war with the Axis powers is virtually inevitable, it would be useful for us to prepare for this coming conflict by preparing the Red Army for winter warfare. %N%N If we set a process in motion now, we could provide winter clothing and equipment to our forces for 75 MPPs. %N%N Through this investment we will avoid suffering unduly from sicknesses during the winter when we are next at war. %N%N Would you like to authorize this expenditure so that we can fight effectively during the winter?
<<TAG_163>>= If the Red Army hadn't invaded Finland in 1939 and then invested in winter equipment after the catastrophic losses it suffered in that war, it is likely that Soviet soldiers would have experienced far worse conditions during the winter campaigns of the Great Patriotic War. %N%N This decision is your opportunity to avoid excessive suffering during winter, and it is recommended that you say (YES).
<<TAG_164>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N The German Foreign Minister has sent us proposals to revise some aspects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. %N%N The main item is that the Germans offer to transfer Lithuania from their sphere of influence to ours. This would enable us to occupy the country next year. %N%N In return they ask us to withdraw eastwards from the Vistula-San river line to the Bug-San river line in Poland. %N%N This would leave the fortress of Brest-Litovsk more vulnerable to attack, and if we say (YES), then this further sign of our friendship with the Axis will move the USSR 5% away from the Allies. %N%N In view of this, would you like to accept this revised Borders and Friendship Treaty?
<<TAG_165>>= Saying (YES) to this will enable us to occupy Lithuania in the coming year, which would increase our income and keep the Axis starting point for an invasion as far away from Leningrad as possible. %N%N On the other hand, Brest-Litovsk will become more vulnerable to assault if we do agree to amend the border to the east of Warsaw. %N%N Negotiations over the final borders between the USSR and Germany did take place as the invasion of Poland was coming to an end, and there was nothing inevitable about the agreements that were reached at the time.
<<TAG_166>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N The German Foreign Minister has sent us proposals to revise some aspects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. %N%N The main item is that the Germans offer to transfer Lithuania from their sphere of influence to ours. %N%N However, if we agree to Ribbentrop's proposal then this further sign of our friendship with the Axis would move the USSR 5-8% away from the Allies. %N%N In view of this, would you like to accept this revised Borders and Friendship Treaty?
<<TAG_167>>= Saying (YES) to this will enable us to occupy Lithuania in the coming year, which would increase our income and keep the Axis starting point for an invasion as far away from Leningrad as possible. %N%N However, if we do say (YES), then our mobilization level will significantly decrease, delaying by several turns the time when we will be able to enter the war against the Axis. %N%N Negotiations over the final borders between the USSR and Germany did take place as the invasion of Poland was coming to an end, and there was nothing inevitable about the agreements that were reached at the time.
<<TAG_168>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N Now would be a good time for us to increase our territory and income by annexing the Baltic States. %N%N One strategic benefit of doing so will be to increase the distance an invader would have to travel before reaching Leningrad. %N%N If you approve, then our forces will advance into the Baltic States up to the border with Germany. %N%N Would you like to annex the Baltic States?
<<TAG_169>>= If you say (YES) to occupying the Baltic States then Soviet income will increase slightly, so it is recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_170>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N With enemy forces advancing through the Baltic to within striking distance of Leningrad, now would be a good time to make preparations to feed the city's defenders in the event of the enemy laying siege to the city. %N%N We could stockpile food and fuel supplies at Volkhov to the east of Leningrad, for a cost of 35 MPPs, so that during the winter should the city be under siege we could send supplies over a frozen Lake Ladoga directly into the city. %N%N To succeed, we will need to ensure that Volkhov remains in our hands, or that we retake it should it fall to the invader. %N%N Would you like to stockpile supplies at Volkhov so that during the winter we can provide a Road of Life to the city of Leningrad?
<<TAG_171>>= Stockpiling Supplies To Feed Leningrad
<<TAG_172>>= The Road of Life played a vital role in sustaining the defenses of Leningrad during its 900 day long siege by Axis forces. %N%N By saying (YES) to this, and maintaining forces to defend Volkhov, we can boost the morale and therefore combat effectiveness of our forces in Leningrad as they resist the invader. %N%N Also ensure that Leningrad has plenty of units in place for its defense before Axis forces reach the city, including a HQ, as once the city has been cut off it will be impossible to deploy new units there.
<<TAG_173>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N Given the large armored formations that both sides can deploy on the Eastern Front, there have been calls for the formation of dedicated anti-tank units. %N%N These will be useful when encountering enemy armored formations, but will be fragile when fighting enemy infantry. %N%N We could at low cost quickly form 3 dedicated Anti-Tank units at Gorki for 200 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 4 turns. %N%N They will deploy at half strength and will need upgrading. %N%N Would you like to form these dedicated Anti-Tank units?
<<TAG_174>>= Anti-Tank Units
<<TAG_175>>= Researching and upgrading these units with Anti-Tank Weapons will ensure that they can inflict maximum damage. %N%N It is cheaper to form these units by saying (YES) than to purchase them via the Purchase screen.
<<TAG_176>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N The situation facing us is now very critical. %N%N We have lost Leningrad, Stalingrad and Moscow. Even Napoleon didn't achieve as much when he invaded in 1812. %N%N Unless you think that we can turn things around, it might be best to ask the enemy for an armistice while peace terms can be discussed. %N%N On behalf of our Allies it is suggested that we offer an unconditional cessation of hostilities to the Axis powers. %N%N Should the Axis accept, the war will now be over. %N%N Would you like to end the war and make peace with the Axis powers?
<<TAG_177>>= Red Army Headquarters %N%N Under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Bessarabia falls into our sphere of influence and now would be a good time to seize this territory. %N%N This will provide us with a buffer zone protecting Odessa from attack. %N%N The operation will cost 15 MPPs with any opposition being swept aside, though it will move Romania 10% towards the Axis. %N%N Would you like to order the Red Army to seize Bessarabia?
<<TAG_178>>= Occupying Bessarabia
<<TAG_179>>= If you say (YES), then the Red Army will seize Bessarabia from Romania, and Romania will swing 10% towards the Axis.

<<TAG_186>>= Prime Minister %NWladyslaw Sikorski %N%N Although the enemy have occupied our country, they have not broken our fighting spirit. %N%N Thousands of our soldiers have escaped to neutral countries, and thousands more are returning to their homes to form an underground army. %N%N The question facing us now is whether those of our men who have escaped abroad should make their way to Britain or France. %N%N Whichever country we head for, we hope to obtain that government's approval to form our own armed forces there. %N%N Would you like to order our soldiers to head for Britain (YES) or France (NO)?
<<TAG_187>>= %N%N If you say (YES), then with British approval we will have the opportunity to form a Polish Corps in the UK. %N%N However, if you say (NO), then the French will have the opportunity to form a Polish Corps near Paris. %N%N It will be best to say (YES) if you think that strengthening Britain's armed forces is a greater priority, or (NO) if you wish to increase France's chances of withstanding invasion. %N%N Given the historic ties between France and Poland, it would only be natural for the thousands of Poles who have escaped the Nazi onslaught to head to France (NO).
<<TAG_188>>= General Wladyslaw Anders %N%N Stalin is willing to allow us to evacuate thousands of Polish soldiers from the USSR. %N%N It would be wise to take advantage of this offer, so that we can leave the USSR and head for the Middle East. %N%N Once there, hopefully we will be able to persuade the British to form these men into a Corps, so that we can play a full role in the struggle ahead for a free Poland. %N%N Alternatively, we can stay in the USSR and seek service in the Red Army. %N%N Would you like to evacuate as many of our soldiers as possible from the USSR to the Middle East (YES), or would you rather stay in the USSR (NO)?
<<TAG_189>>= Negotiations took place between Stalin and General Anders in the spring and summer of 1942, leading to the departure of tens of thousands of Polish soldiers and a smaller number of civilians from the USSR. %N%N Once in the Middle East, the British provided them with assistance and in early 1943 started forming a Polish Corps for service in the Middle East and Mediterranean. This Corps distinguished itself at Monte Cassino the following year. %N%N If you say (YES), then the British will have the opportunity to form this Polish Corps at Kuwait. %N%N If you say (NO), then the USSR will have the opportunity to form a Polish Corps to support Red Army operations on the Eastern Front.
<<TAG_190>>= Thousands Of Polish Soldiers And Civilians Leave The USSR
<<TAG_191>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Our offensive against Poland has been a great success and the Polish army has been decisively defeated. %N%N Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, is now urging us to pull back to our previously agreed partition lines and honor our Non-Aggression Pact with the USSR. %N%N If we say (YES) to honoring the Pact then we will gain imports from the USSR worth 25MPPs a turn. %N%N If we say (NO), then we will lose these imports, and the USSR will swing 20-30% towards the Allies as we push the Red Army out of Poland. %N%N Should we honor the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and cede Eastern Poland to the USSR?
<<TAG_192>>= If we say (YES) to this then our economy will benefit significantly from imports from the USSR. %N%N If we say (NO) to this then we will have a better launching point for a future invasion of the USSR. %N%N However, by saying (NO) we will have to invade sooner than we might have wished due to the anger we will trigger in the USSR by not honoring the Pact. %N%N We will also only have an opportunity to annex Lithuania in the spring of 1940 if we say (YES) to this. Otherwise we would have to invade that country if we wish to seize it, and doing so would swing the USSR dramatically towards the Allies.
<<TAG_193>>= Germany Honors The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact
<<TAG_194>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N With French morale low and their military soundly defeated, the newly appointed Prime Minister, Marshal Pétain, is willing to sign an armistice with us. %N%N Terms of the Armistice dictate that we will occupy northern France, while the French government will continue to operate from Vichy in southern France. %N%N Pétain has also agreed to maintain internal order and defend the remaining French territories, including French possessions in North Africa, from Allied assault. %N%N Alternatively, if we don't wish to sign an armistice with France, Mussolini assures us that his forces can easily crush the remaining French defenders in Tunis and Algiers. %N%N Should we therefore sign an armistice with Pétain and create Vichy France (YES) or continue our invasion until all of France including Algiers is in our hands (NO)?
<<TAG_195>>= If we say (YES) to this then the battle of France will be over, and we will be free to start planning our next offensive. %N%N If we say (NO) to this then we will need to invade Algeria and capture Algiers in order to force the French to surrender. %N%N Obtaining a French surrender by taking Algiers would put us in a better position to threaten Gibraltar. %N%N One word of caution is that our agents report that further French troops will mobilize in Algiers if we say (NO) to Pétain's request for an armistice. %N%N That said, one good reason for saying (NO) to this is that by conquering Algiers, upon France's surrender we will have the opportunity to entice Spain into entering the war.
<<TAG_196>>= Germany Creates Vichy France
<<TAG_197>>= Foreign Minister %NJoachim von Ribbentrop %N%N Now that we have captured Algiers, our intelligence reports from Spain suggest that Franco may be willing to join the Tripartite Pact. %N%N Abwehr reports that it will cost us 800 MPPs, at 200 MPPs a turn for 4 turns, to help put Spain on a war footing, mainly to feed the starving population. Franco will also seize some French territory in North Africa in return for his assistance. %N%N Be warned that the USA will react negatively towards this, but gaining a new ally and the strategic importance of Spain's location will probably make this worthwhile. %N%N Shall we invite Franco to join the Axis?
<<TAG_198>>= Supplies To Spain
<<TAG_199>>= Spain was struggling to recover from her civil war and so Franco was very reluctant to involve Spain directly in the war, though he did provide much assistance to the Axis short of doing so. %N%N Given Franco's reluctance, to obtain his help Germany would have had to provide him with territory in North Africa and much in the way of food supplies. %N%N As you have made the effort to capture Algiers, unless the military situation elsewhere limits your ability to pay the cost of Spanish war entry, it will be best to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_200>>= Franco Joins The Axis In Exchange For French Territory In Africa
<<TAG_201>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N The Vichy French capital ship Strasbourg was sabotaged by French naval officers and sunk at Toulon. %N%N Despite this, our naval experts are confident that the vessel can be refloated and restored to service, but doing so will cost 140 MPPs, at 70 MPPs a turn for 2 turns. %N%N Would you like to order salvage work to commence?
<<TAG_202>>= Restoring the Strasbourg
<<TAG_203>>= The Strasbourg was scuttled when Germany invaded Vichy France in November 1942. %N%N She was then raised by the Italians and handed over to the Germans, passed back to the Italians, then back to the Vichy authorities, before being bombed by US aircraft in 1944, sunk, and then raised again. %N%N What a war record!
<<TAG_204>>= Germany Refits French Capital Ships
<<TAG_205>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Having captured Northern France, we now have access to the important naval base of St. Nazaire. %N%N This could be a very useful base for launching new naval units, but it will require some investment in order to prepare it for use. %N%N The estimated cost of refitting the port is 50MPPs, at 10 MPPs a turn for 5 turns. %N%N Would you like to invest in upgrading the port of St. Nazaire so that we can launch new naval units there?
<<TAG_206>>= Construction Work At St. Nazaire
<<TAG_207>>= Saying (YES) to this will be beneficial if you are embarking on a concerted effort to hit British merchant shipping in the Atlantic. %N%N The reason for this is that naval units launched at St. Nazaire will be able to start their cruises much closer to British shipping lanes than those having to leave German waters via the North Sea for the Atlantic. %N%N Note that if we do enhance St. Nazaire then the British may launch an attack on the port which could prevent us from using it, just as they did historically in 1942 when they launched Operation Chariot.
<<TAG_208>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N The hull of our proposed Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin is currently awaiting completion. %N%N Completing it as an Aircraft Carrier will cost us 200MPPs, at 25 MPPs a turn for 8 turns, and it will be ready in January 1942. %N%N Would you like to continue with production as an Aircraft Carrier (YES)?
<<TAG_209>>= Naval Plan Z
<<TAG_210>>= Whether it is better to continue working on the Graf Zeppelin as an Aircraft Carrier (YES) or to save the MPPs and use them elsewhere (NO) depends on your overall strategy and whether you can afford the cost of deploying it as an Aircraft Carrier. %N%N If you say (YES) to this then it could serve in either the Baltic or the Atlantic, providing long range air support and reconnaissance to our vessels. %N%N The Germans did have two Carriers in production in the late 1930s, the other being planned was intended to be called Peter Strasser, but neither were ever finished.
<<TAG_211>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Given the proximity of enemy forces to our homeland, the time has come to mobilize all our reserves. %N%N There are thousands of men serving in the rear areas, in the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine, who could be better used if formed into infantry units for the defense of the Reich. %N%N At a cost of 150 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 3 turns, we could use these men to form 4 Volksgrenadier Corps at Berlin. %N%N Doing so will raise our National Morale by 5,000 points. %N%N Would you like to order the formation of these Volksgrenadier units?
<<TAG_212>>= Volksgrenadier Units
<<TAG_213>>= As the Allies advance on our borders, it is best to say (YES) to increase our field forces by raising these Volksgrenadier Corps.
<<TAG_214>>= Germany Announces The Formation Of Volksgrenadier Corps%N%N 
<<TAG_215>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N We are in the process of forming a People's Militia, the Volkssturm, that will mobilize to defend the homeland as the enemy advance. %N%N For a cost of 50 MPPs, at 25 MPPs a turn for 2 turns, we could provide the Volkssturm with better equipment and training so that its units will be better able to slow the enemy's advances into Germany. %N%N Doing so will raise our National Morale by 2,500 points. %N%N Would you like to invest in improving the Volkssturm?
<<TAG_216>>= The Volkssturm
<<TAG_217>>= Germany Announces The Formation Of A People's Militia Called The Volkssturm
<<TAG_218>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N The Indian Nationalist Leader Subhas Chandra Bose is keen to form a 'Free India' Legion to help liberate his country from British rule, and he has asked if he can recruit among the many Indians currently held in our prisoner of war camps. %N%N If we agree, it will cost us 15 MPPs to equip this formation, and it will provide us with a Garrison unit. %N%N Would you like to authorize the formation of a Free India Legion?
<<TAG_219>>= Forming The Free Indian Legion
<<TAG_220>>= Germany recruited at least 2,000 Indian soldiers to serve in the Free India Legion, and they served mainly in France and the Low Countries. %N%N Saying (YES) to Subhas Chandra Bose's request to raise this Legion is a cheap way of raising another Garrison unit.
<<TAG_221>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Lithuania remains within our sphere of influence and seizing the country before Stalin is ready to counter us would give us a good launching pad for a future invasion of the USSR. %N%N Annexing Lithuania would undoubtedly cause some alarm in the Soviet Union, but it shouldn't lead directly to conflict unless we were to follow it up with acts of aggression against Latvia or Estonia. %N%N Would you like to authorize the annexation of Lithuania?
<<TAG_222>>= None
<<TAG_223>>= By saying (YES) to this, Germany will annex Lithuania in March 1940, and the USSR will swing 7-10% towards the Allies. %N%N If you say (NO), then the USSR will have an opportunity to annex Lithuania in June 1940.
<<TAG_224>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Romania is under pressure to settle its territorial disputes with its neighbors. %N%N Hungary demands Northern Transylvania, and Bulgaria claims Southern Dobruja. %N%N We could intervene to force Romania to hand over the territories demanded by Hungary and Bulgaria (YES) and this will encourage Hungary and Bulgaria to join the Axis sooner than they might have done. %N%N Would you like to enforce a settlement of Romania's territorial disputes in favor of Hungary and Bulgaria?
<<TAG_225>>= If you say (YES), then Romania will lose Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja from the end of August 1940. %N%N King Carol II will be forced to abdicate as Antonescu takes power, and in January 1941 Antonescu will crush the Iron Guard's rebellion. %N%N If you say (YES), then Romania will still join the Axis but it will join later than it would have done. %N%N By saying (NO) to this Romania retains its territorial integrity and may join the Axis slightly earlier, though the war entrance of Hungary and Bulgaria may be slightly delayed.
<<TAG_226>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N We have some U-Boats at Kiel that could be usefully employed in the Black Sea for service against the USSR. %N%N Sending these U-Boats to Constanta in Romania will cost us 35 MPPs, and will provide us with a strength 5 U-Boat unit there in a month's time. %N%N Would you like to send these U-Boats to serve in the Black Sea?
<<TAG_227>>= Sending U-Boats To Constanta
<<TAG_228>>= These U-Boats are currently being used as training vessels as they aren't suitable for service in the North Sea or Atlantic, but they could play a role in protecting Romania and Bulgaria from any Soviet amphibious assaults. %N%N They could also play a secondary role in interdicting enemy coastal shipping and therefore reducing the supply value of the enemy's ports.
<<TAG_229>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N The 23rd U-Boat Flotilla is due to deploy shortly at Kiel in the Baltic, though it could perhaps be put to better use if we were to send it overland to serve in the Mediterranean. %N%N Arriving with full research whatever is decided, transferring this U-Boat unit to Pola in the Adriatic will cost us 35 MPPs. From Pola it can sail into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping. %N%N If you say (YES), then it will deploy at Pola on the 12th September 1941. %N%N If you say (NO), then it will deploy at Kiel on the 29th August 1941. %N%N Would you like to order Admiral Raeder to send this U-Boat unit to Pola (YES) or Kiel (NO)?
<<TAG_230>>= Sending U-Boats To Pola
<<TAG_231>>= By saying (YES) to this, we will be better able to intercept Allied shipping and invasion forces in the Mediterranean.
<<TAG_232>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Italy has surrendered and Mussolini is now a prisoner of the Allies. %N%N Otto Skorzeny has discovered that he is currently being held at the Campo Imperatore Hotel in the Apennines, and he proposes launching a glider borne operation using elite forces to rescue him. %N%N Once freed, Mussolini could be used as a figurehead to raise a pro-Axis unit from loyal Italians. %N%N Launching Skorzeny's mission to rescue Mussolini, codename Operation Oak, will cost us 10 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to authorize this rescue attempt?
<<TAG_233>>= Operation Oak
<<TAG_234>>= If you say (YES) to this, and it is recommended to do so, then Otto Skorzeny will attempt to rescue Mussolini. %N%N Skorzeny's mission has a 90% chance of success. %N%N If he is successful then Germany will be presented with an opportunity to form an Italian Fascist Corps in northern Italy, and German National Morale will rise by 1,000 points.
<<TAG_235>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Following Mussolini's rescue we can use him as the figurehead for the formation of a pro-Axis force in northern Italy. %N%N Mussolini still has thousands of supporters and for 75 MPPs we could form them into an Italian Corps that will operate under our orders. %N%N Would you like to approve the formation of this unit?
<<TAG_236>>= Italian Corps
<<TAG_237>>= This unit represents the armed forces of the Italian Social Republic that was formed after Mussolini's rescue. %N%N Saying (YES) to this is a cheap way of raising a Corps to assist in defending our remaining territory in Italy.
<<TAG_238>>= Foreign Minister %NJoachim von Ribbentrop %N%N It is my great pleasure to inform you that with our recent victories, the Allies have offered peace on favorable terms. %N%N If we accept their offer, the war will be over and we will have achieved a Major Victory. %N%N Would you like to accept the Allied peace offer?
<<TAG_239>>= By saying (YES) to this, the game will end with an Axis Major Victory, whereas if you say (NO), then the game will continue.
<<TAG_240>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Lieutenant-General Kurt Student's 7th Flieger Division is a partially formed and trained unit of paratroopers. %N%N Despite its incompleteness it could be used in the latter stages of the invasion of Poland, or in an early attack on France. %N%N Alternatively, we could allow it to complete its training and formation, in which case it will deploy at full strength at Hamburg at the end of this year. %N%N Would you therefore like to deploy the understrength and only partially trained 7th Flieger Division at Breslau now (YES), or let it complete its training so that it will deploy at full strength ready for operations in 1940 (NO)? %N%N If you say (YES), then you will receive 50 MPPs that had previously been assigned to completing its training and formation. These can be invested wherever you wish, either in reinforcing this unit or elsewhere.
<<TAG_241>>= Deploying 7th Flieger Division
<<TAG_242>>= The 7th Flieger Division was still forming when war broke out, so rushing it into service before it is complete will require spending MPPs to bring it up to full strength. %N%N However, by saying (YES) to this it will be available for operations sooner and it could be useful if you wish to follow up your victory in Poland with an immediate offensive elsewhere.
<<TAG_243>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N The Regent of Hungary, Admiral Horthy, is highly likely to switch sides and join the Allies. %N%N This could be very dangerous for us, as if the Allies gain Hungary then our southern flank will be cut wide open and the enemy could swarm into Austria and southern Germany. %N%N To prevent this, Otto Skorzeny is ready to overthrow Horthy and replace him with Ferenc Szálasi, leader of the Arrow Cross, who will keep Hungary in the war. %N%N Codenamed Operation Panzerfaust, for 50 MPPs we can secure Hungary and force the Allies to fight for the country. %N%N Would you like to launch Operation Panzerfaust to keep Hungary on our side?
<<TAG_244>>= Launching Operation Panzerfaust
<<TAG_245>>= If you say (YES), then Admiral Horthy will be overthrown and replaced as Regent of Hungary by Ferenc Szálasi. %N%N Szálasi's Arrow Cross movement will keep Hungary in the war, and German Garrison units will deploy at Budapest and Debrecen to assist in slowing any Allied advance on Hungary. %N%N Hungary would only surrender were Allied units to capture Budapest. %N%N If you say (NO), then once 2 Allied units are within 6 hexes of Budapest there will be a 25% chance per turn of Hungary switching sides and joining the Allies. %N%N If Hungary switches sides then Hungarian Garrison units will deploy at both Budapest and Debrecen, to provide the Allies with time to advance to assist their new allies. These would be in addition to any remaining Hungarian units. %N%N Germany would also lose 2,000 National Morale points should Hungary switch sides, so it is recommended to say (YES) and launch Operation Panzerfaust.
<<TAG_246>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N The Finns are having talks with the Soviet Union about pulling out of the war. %N%N We could intervene by providing Finland with aid worth 150 MPPs to keep her in the war, as this sign of our continued support should convince Marshal Mannerheim and the Finnish government to continue the fight. %N%N This expenditure will simply suffice to keep the Finns on our side, it will not increase their armed forces, so sending reinforcements to the country may still be necessary. If none are currently available, then consider well before saying (YES). %N%N If you say (NO), then Finland will immediately withdraw from the war and Germany will lose 2,000 National Morale points. %N%N Would you like to spend 150 MPPs on aid to Finland to stop the Finns signing an armistice with Stalin (YES) or shall we stand by as Finland makes peace with the USSR (NO)?
<<TAG_247>>= Keeping Finland in the War
<<TAG_248>>= If you believe that the situation can be saved and Finland defended, then saying (YES) and spending 150 MPPs may be worthwhile. %N%N If you say (NO) and stand by while Finland makes peace with the USSR, it will send out the wrong message to the world, and the loss of this ally will cause us to lose 2,000 National Morale points. %N%N As this expenditure does not provide the Finns with any greater means to defend themselves, only say (YES) if Finland either has the strength to defend herself, or if German forces are available to assist.
<<TAG_249>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N With the British defeated in Egypt and Cairo in our hands, there are thousands of Egyptian Nationalists calling for the right to take up arms and serve with us in this war. %N%N We could form these men into a Garrison unit to help protect our gains in Egypt and the Middle East. %N%N Raising this unit in Cairo will cost 25 MPPs. %N%N Would you like to authorize recruitment and training for this Egyptian Legion?
<<TAG_250>>= Recruiting an Egyptian unit
<<TAG_251>>= Egyptian Nationalists hoped to take advantage of an Axis victory over the British to gain independence for their country. %N%N They may have been disappointed had Germany won the war, but in the immediate excitement following an Axis victory in Egypt no doubt the Germans would have found sufficient volunteers to form an Egyptian Legion.
<<TAG_252>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N With Yugoslavia surrendered and occupied by our forces, we could solidify our position in the area by adjusting some borders and setting up a new and friendly state in Croatia. %N%N Croatia's capital will be Zagreb, where if you say (YES) a Croatian Garrison unit will deploy for service. %N%N Forming a Croatian state will cost 50 MPPs, though in the long run this cost will be offset by Zagreb's enhanced economic performance and the services of the Croatians. %N%N Would you like to adjust Yugoslavia's borders and form an independent Croatian state?
<<TAG_253>>= Dividing Yugoslavia
<<TAG_254>>= It is both economically and militarily beneficial to say (YES), as by doing so you will gain in income and the Croatian Garrison unit can be used against partisans in Yugoslavia. %N%N Other territorial adjustments that will come with saying (YES) are that Germany and Hungary will gain small portions of territory in northern Yugoslavia, and the towns of Novi Sad and Ljubljana will go to Hungary and Italy respectively.
<<TAG_255>>= Grand Admiral %N%N Say (YES) if you would you like our ships to continue sailing through the Gibraltar Strait to the Atlantic. %N%N If not, then say (NO) and they will remain in their current position.
<<TAG_256>>= This event represents the ability the Axis had to slip small numbers of ships through the Gibraltar Strait. %N%N However, sending units through the Strait is not without risk as they may end their turn adjacent to Gibraltar, making them vulnerable to enemy attack.
<<TAG_257>>= Grand Admiral %N%N Say (YES) if you would you like our ships to continue sailing through the Gibraltar Strait to the Mediterranean. %N%N If not, then say (NO) and they will remain in their current position.
<<TAG_258>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N The Italian Embassy in Baghdad reports that Rashid Ali needs weapons, money, and air support. %N%N The Italians are preparing to send some aid, but to have any effect we will also need to send a mission of our own, called Sonderkommando Junck, at a cost of 30 MPPs. %N%N Unfortunately, even with our support, the Iraqis are very unlikely to hold out indefinitely, but this mission could make them hold out for longer, and therefore delay the enemy's resumption of oil production. %N%N Would you like to send Sonderkommando Junck to support the Iraqis?
<<TAG_259>>= Sending Aid To The Iraqis
<<TAG_260>>= By sending aid to Iraq we will strengthen Rashid Ali's position when Allied forces advance on the Iraqi capital. %N%N This will effectively reduce the chance of the Iraqis surrendering when two or more Allied units reach Baghdad, from 75% to 25% per turn. %N%N Saying (YES) to this will also increase our diplomatic position in Syria, as the presence of our aircraft moving through Syria will move that country 10-15% towards the Axis.
<<TAG_261>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Significant numbers of Don Cossacks have deserted to our lines, and their representatives are making contact asking to take service with us in our struggle against the Bolsheviks. %N%N For 50 MPPs we could make use of these cossacks to form a half strength Cavalry Corps at Rostov. %N%N Would you like to authorize the formation of a Don Cossack Cavalry Corps?
<<TAG_262>>= Don Cossack Cavalry Corps
<<TAG_263>>= Raised from Red Army deserters, prisoners of war and other volunteers, the Germans began forming a Cossack formation in the autumn of 1942, and this expanded over time to reach Corps strength. %N%N This is a cheap way of increasing your armed forces, so it is recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_264>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Among the many thousands of prisoners we have taken is a senior Red Army officer, General Vlasov, who is rapidly becoming a leading figure in promoting the anti-Bolshevik message to his fellow countrymen. %N%N There are already thousands of former Red Army soldiers serving in our army, and we could make use of Vlasov to raise a specifically Russian Corps to assist in our struggle against Stalin's regime. %N%N With your approval this full strength Corps will deploy at Minsk for a cost of 100 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 2 turns. %N%N Would you like to authorize the formation of a Russian Liberation Army Corps?
<<TAG_265>>= Russian Liberation Army Corps
<<TAG_266>>= %N%N Raising this Russian force is a cost effective way of increasing your armed forces, so it is recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_267>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N There is a potential threat of amphibious invasion from the Western Allies along the northern coast of France. %N%N It is therefore recommended that we strengthen our defenses by constructing static Coastal Gun batteries near Brest, Le Havre, Amiens and Calais. %N%N These batteries could prove crucial in repelling any invasion, as they are armed with formidable naval guns that will automatically attempt to engage enemy amphibious units that attempt to land. %N%N Their construction will cost 200 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 4 turns. %N%N Would you like to authorize the construction of these Coastal Gun batteries as part of our Atlantic Wall?
<<TAG_268>>= Atlantic Wall Fortifications
<<TAG_269>>= Although expensive, the construction of these Coastal Gun Batteries will significantly strengthen our defenses and could potentially delay the enemy's invasion preparations, so that is a good reason to say (YES) to this. %N%N Ensure that they are protected from air attack and that mobile forces remain nearby to counterattack any enemy landings. %N%N Any units currently occupying the hexes where the Coastal Guns will be deployed will be moved out, and the Coastal Guns will deploy in the next turn. Units may temporarily disappear, but they will be returned.
<<TAG_270>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Now that the Polish campaign is over, we have an opportunity to adjust some of the details of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. %N%N It is proposed that we offer to transfer Lithuania from our sphere of influence to that of the USSR's. %N%N While this would enable the Soviets to occupy the country in due course, in return we would ask the USSR to withdraw eastwards from along the Vistula-San river line, to the Bug-San river line. %N%N This would put us in a much better position to attack the fortress of Brest-Litovsk when we invade the USSR. If Stalin approves this proposal, and he may not, then it would also move the USSR 5% away from the Allies. %N%N Would you like to offer this revised Borders and Friendship Treaty to the USSR?
<<TAG_271>>= Saying (YES) to this means that this proposal is presented to the USSR. If Stalin agrees, and this is not guaranteed, then it will give the USSR the opportunity to occupy Lithuania in 1940. %N%N We will also only have an opportunity to annex Lithuania in the spring of 1940 if we say (NO) to this. Otherwise we would have to invade that country if we wish to seize it, and doing so would swing the USSR dramatically towards the Allies. %N%N Note that the area between Grodno and Wilno, including both locations, will be transferred to Lithuania on the 27th October 1939 irrespective of the decision. %N%N Negotiations over the final borders between the USSR and Germany did take place as the invasion of Poland was coming to an end, and there was nothing inevitable about the agreements that were reached at the time.
<<TAG_272>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Now that the Polish campaign is over, we have an opportunity to adjust some of the details of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. %N%N It is proposed that we offer to transfer Lithuania from our sphere of influence to that of the USSR's. %N%N While it is true that this would enable them to occupy the country in due course, if Stalin approves, and he may not, then we would benefit by having the USSR move 5-8% away from the Allies. %N%N Would you like to offer this revised Borders and Friendship Treaty to the USSR?
<<TAG_273>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Lithuania remains within our sphere of influence and it would give us a good launching pad for a future invasion of the USSR should we seize the country before Stalin is ready to counter us. %N%N Annexing Lithuania would undoubtedly cause some alarm in the Soviet Union, but it shouldn't lead directly to conflict unless we were to follow it up with acts of aggression against Latvia or Estonia. %N%N Would you like to authorize the annexation of Lithuania?
<<TAG_274>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Lithuania remains within our sphere of influence as the USSR has rejected our offer of a Revised Borders and Friendship Treaty. %N%N Lithuania would give us a good launching pad for a future invasion of the USSR should we seize the country before Stalin is ready to counter us. %N%N Annexing Lithuania would undoubtedly cause some alarm in the Soviet Union, but it shouldn't lead directly to conflict unless we were to follow it up with acts of aggression against Latvia or Estonia. %N%N Would you like to authorize the annexation of Lithuania?
<<TAG_275>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Now that Norway has surrendered, we need to reconsider the current convoy route from Narvik. %N%N The route from Narvik is very susceptible to attack from Allied aircraft and shipping. It could also be threatened by enemy forces were they to land at Narvik. %N%N One solution would be to have all our Iron Ore come directly from Sweden, with only a reduced convoy sailing from Kristiansand in southern Norway (YES). %N%N If we do so say (YES), then our potential income will be less, as no convoys can sail from Sweden in the winter, but what we do receive from Scandinavia will be safer from attack. %N%N Would you like to amend Norway's convoy route (YES) or take the risk that our convoys from Narvik will be able to reach Germany largely intact (NO)?
<<TAG_276>>= Except during winter when Sweden cannot export directly to Germany, this increases the value of Sweden's convoy to Germany while reducing that of Norway's. %N%N Norway's convoy will also now travel directly from Kristiansand in southern Norway to Cuxhaven in Germany, which is a far more secure route. %N%N Overall this is only of economic benefit if the Allies are capable of causing significant disruption to the Norwegian convoys. Bear in mind when deciding that their ability to do so will likely increase as the war progresses. %N%N Should Narvik fall at any time to the Allies, then the Norwegian convoy will automatically switch to sailing from Kristiansand even if you do not transfer it via this Decision.
<<TAG_277>>= Germany Amends Its Norwegian Convoy Routes To Protect Its Ore Supplies
<<TAG_278>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Now that Norway has joined the Axis, we need to reconsider the current convoy route from Narvik. %N%N The route from Narvik is very susceptible to attack from Allied aircraft and shipping. It could also be threatened by enemy forces were they to land at Narvik. %N%N One solution would be to have all our Iron Ore come directly from Sweden, with only a reduced convoy sailing from Kristiansand in southern Norway (YES). %N%N If we do so say (YES), then our potential income will be less, as no convoys can sail from Sweden in the winter, but what we do receive from Scandinavia will be safer from attack. %N%N Would you like to amend Norway's convoy route (YES) or take the risk that our convoys from Narvik will be able to reach Germany largely intact (NO)?
<<TAG_279>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N With Allied forces in Algeria, the time has come to put into action our plan to occupy Vichy France. %N%N Codenamed Case Anton, for a cost of 75 MPPs our forces will occupy Vichy France. %N%N Launching this operation will prevent the Vichy authorities in mainland France from joining the Allies. %N%N Our intelligence sources report that there is an 80% chance of the French scuttling their fleet at Toulon rather than ordering it to set sail to join the Allies at Algiers. %N%N One thing to be aware of is that once we have occupied Vichy France, Partisan activity will be likely in some areas. %N%N Would you like to order Case Anton to be put into effect in order to occupy Vichy France?
<<TAG_280>>= Occupying Vichy France
<<TAG_281>>= If you say (YES), then Germany occupies Vichy France, with a Garrison unit deploying at Marseille. %N%N There is an 80% chance of the French scuttling their ships, and this is tested separately against both elements of the Vichy fleet (the Provence Battleship and Jean de Vienne Light Cruiser) so that either or both might be scuttled. %N%N If any ships aren't scuttled then the UK will receive them in Algiers. %N%N If you say (NO) and Vichy France is still neutral when the Allies liberate Paris, then there will be a 50% chance per turn of Vichy France swinging 15-25% towards the Allies in every subsequent turn. %N%N It is recommended to say (YES) and occupy Vichy France now.
<<TAG_282>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N In order to protect our position in Libya, and protect against an invasion of Sicily or even mainland Italy, we should occupy Tunisia now that the Allies are in Algeria. %N%N Occupying Tunisia will cost 50 MPPs, and a Garrison unit will deploy at Tunis. %N%N This operation could buy us some time in order to send reinforcements to the area, or to prepare our defenses against an Allied invasion of Italy. %N%N Would you like to issue the order for Tunisia to be occupied?
<<TAG_283>>= Occupying Tunisia
<<TAG_284>>= If your position in North Africa is collapsing with no hope of saving your position there, then say (NO). %N%N But if you have reinforcements en route and gaining a base at Tunis will enable you to restore the situation, possibly even turn the tide against the Allies in this theater, then say (YES).
<<TAG_285>>= Fuhrerhauptquartier %N%N In order to assist our Italian allies in North Africa, it is recommended that we send some German forces, to be known as the Deutsches Afrikakorps, to deal with the British. %N%N If successful, this formation could spearhead the way for an advance into Egypt and beyond. %N%N If you say (YES), then a full strength Headquarters and the following half strength units will deploy at Benghazi: an Infantry Corps, Anti-Tank, reconnaissance, Artillery, Tank, Fighter and Tactical Bomber units. %N%N They will arrive with full research for a cost of 500 MPPs, at 100 MPPs a turn for 5 turns. %N%N Would you like to form the Afrika Korps for service in North Africa?
<<TAG_286>>= Afrika Korps
<<TAG_287>>= The effect that a successful advance into Egypt would have on Britain could be decisive in winning the war, as with the Middle East in our hands we could even consider an advance into the USSR from the south. %N%N It is therefore strongly recommended that you say (YES) to this and deploy the Afrika Korps.
<<TAG_288>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Our iron ore imports from Norway could be threatened by the British who may make a move to invade Norway and cut off our convoys. %N%N It is therefore strongly recommended that we move quickly to occupy the country, so we have devised a plan to move units secretly to land in Norway. %N%N These forces should be sufficient to deal with any Norwegian resistance, and probably also to repel any Allied counter moves. %N%N Preparations will cost 180 MPPs at 90 MPPs a turn for 2 turns, and the invasion will take place on the 9th April 1940. %N%N Would you like to authorize the invasion of Norway?
<<TAG_289>>= Invading Norway
<<TAG_290>>= If you say (YES), then Germany will invade Norway on the 9th April 1940. %N%N A half strength Corps will land at Oslo, and strength 3 Garrison units will occupy Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, Stavanger and Kristiansand. %N%N At Oslo we will meet some resistance as Norwegian shore batteries will inflict 1-4 points of damage on our forces as they land. %N%N On the diplomatic front, the USA will swing 3-5% towards the Allies in response to our invasion. %N%N If an Anglo-French expedition was sent to Finland then it is possible that these forces will be used in an attempt to retake Narvik, in which case it would be wise to reinforce the Garrison there as soon as possible.
<<TAG_291>>= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Given the large armored formations that both sides can deploy on the Eastern Front, there have been calls for the formation of dedicated anti-tank units. %N%N These will be useful when encountering enemy armored formations, but will be fragile when fighting enemy infantry. %N%N We could at low cost quickly form 3 dedicated Anti-Tank units at Warsaw for 200 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 4 turns. %N%N They will deploy at half strength and will need upgrading. %N%N Would you like to form these dedicated Anti-Tank units?
<<TAG_292>>= Foreign Minister %NJoachim von Ribbentrop %N%N It is my great pleasure to inform you that following our recent victories, the Allies have offered peace on favorable terms. %N%N If we accept their offer, the war will be over and we will have achieved a Major Victory. %N%N Would you like to accept the Allied peace offer?
<<TAG_293>>= Fuhrerhauptquartier %N%N In order to assist our Italian allies in North Africa, it is recommended that we send some German forces, to be known as the Deutsches Afrikakorps, to deal with the British. %N%N If successful, this formation could spearhead the way for an advance into Egypt and beyond. %N%N If you say (YES), then a full strength Headquarters and the following half strength units will deploy at Tripoli: an Infantry Corps, Anti-Tank, reconnaissance, Artillery, Tank, Fighter and Tactical Bomber units. %N%N They will arrive with full research for a cost of 500 MPPs, at 100 MPPs a turn for 5 turns. %N%N Would you like to form the Afrika Korps for service in North Africa?
<<TAG_294>>= Fuhrerhauptquartier %N%N In order to assist our Italian allies now they have lost Tripoli, it is recommended that we send some German forces, to be known as the Deutsches Afrikakorps, to deal with the British. %N%N This formation could spearhead an offensive to recapture Libya and then advance into Egypt and beyond. %N%N If you say (YES), then a full strength Headquarters and the following half strength units will deploy at Trieste: an Infantry Corps, Anti-Tank, reconnaissance, Artillery, Tank, Fighter and Tactical Bomber units. %N%N They will arrive with full research for a cost of 500 MPPs, at 100 MPPs a turn for 5 turns. %N%N Would you like to form the Afrika Korps for service in the Mediterranean?
<<TAG_295>>= The loss of Libya leaves Italy exposed to invasion, so we can use the Afrika Korps to either regain the initiative in North Africa, or to assist in the defense of Italy. %N%N It is therefore strongly recommended that you say (YES) to this and deploy the Afrika Korps.
<<TAG_296>>= The loss of much of Libya leaves Italy exposed to invasion, so we can use the Afrika Korps to either regain the initiative in North Africa, or to assist in the defense of Italy. %N%N It is therefore strongly recommended that you say (YES) to this and deploy the Afrika Korps.
<<TAG_297>>= Foreign Minister %N%N Now would be a good time for us to move into Denmark, to secure our northern flank and the food imports that we receive from this country. %N%N It would also have maximum effect if we occupy the country at the same time as we land in Norway, as this will provide us with a much more secure route to Norway. It is therefore planned to launch our invasion in early April 1940. %N%N We are confident of only facing minimal resistance from the Danish army, and in order to minimize disruption we intend to leave the Danish government and King in place. %N%N As a result our move into Denmark will only cost us 50MPPs. %N%N Would you like to authorize preparations for the occupation of Denmark to commence?
<<TAG_298>>= Danish Occupation
<<TAG_299>>= By saying (YES), Germany will occupy Denmark on the 9th April 1940, while discontent in Iceland will disrupt Axis supply there. %N%N The British will automatically occupy the Faroe Islands in response, and they will probably send an expedition to occupy Iceland in May 1940. %N%N If the British do not occupy Iceland then we could use Reykjavik as a naval base, though were we to send any Axis ground or air units there to protect the base then US mobilization would increase 8-12%. %N%N If you say (NO) to this, you will have to invade Denmark yourself in order to gain control of the country, and the Allies will still be likely to occupy Iceland in response. %N%N As a result, it is strongly recommended to say (YES) to this.
<<TAG_300>>= Wolfram Imports From Spain
<<TAG_301>>= Imports From The USSR
<<TAG_302>>= Chrome Imports From Turkey
<<TAG_303>>= Imports From Switzerland
<<TAG_304>>= Office of the Navy %NAdmiral Cavagnari %N%N Work is continuing on the Roma Battleship at Trieste, though it has been suggested that rather than add another Battleship to our fleet, we should instead convert her into an Aircraft Carrier, to be named the Aquila. %N%N Converting her into an Aircraft Carrier will take about two and a half years and will cost 200MPPs, at 25 MPPs a turn for 8 turns. %N%N Alternatively, we could simply carry on the work of completing her as a Battleship for free, in which guise she will be ready to enter service in June 1942. %N%N Would you like to convert the Roma into the Aquila Aircraft Carrier for this extra cost (YES), or complete her production as a Battleship (NO)?
<<TAG_305>>= The Aquila Aircraft Carrier
<<TAG_306>>= Converting the Roma into an Aircraft Carrier will be expensive, and whether or not this is worthwhile really depends on your overall Axis strategy. %N%N If you plan to invade the UK before turning east to knock the USSR out of the war, then this carrier will probably not have a big impact on the war. %N%N But if you wish to dominate the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, then having a carrier to provide mobile air support could be crucial in the struggles ahead against British and US forces in these areas.
<<TAG_307>>= Commander in Chief %N%N To ensure an Axis victory in the decisive conflict in the east, it would be advisable for us to send an Italian Expeditionary Force to serve alongside our German allies. %N%N Given your approval, this force will consist of a Headquarters unit and two Corps. %N%N Forming it will cost us 400 MPPs, at 40 MPPs a turn for 10 turns, and it will deploy near Warsaw for service on the Eastern Front. %N%N Would you like to order the formation of an Italian Expeditionary Force?
<<TAG_308>>= Expeditionary Force
<<TAG_309>>= In July 1941 Mussolini sent three divisions to serve on the Eastern Front as a gesture of Axis solidarity. %N%N They were later reinforced by seven more divisions and formed into the Italian Eighth Army, suffering greatly when the Red Army launched Operation Uranus around Stalingrad in November 1942.
<<TAG_310>>= Office of the Navy %NAdmiral Riccardi %N%N One of the French vessels scuttled at Toulon, the Light Cruiser Jean de Vienne, could be salvaged and refitted for service in the Italian Navy. %N%N The work required would be considerable, but we could have it salvaged and raised in port at Toulon shortly with a strength of 2. %N%N Raising the Jean de Vienne would cost 60 MPPs, and in our service she would be called the FR.11. %N%N Would you like to salvage this vessel so we can then refit it further for service against the Allies?
<<TAG_311>>= Raising the Light Cruiser Jean de Vienne
<<TAG_312>>= The French managed to scuttle many ships when the Axis invaded Vichy France, and much work had to be done to salvage and repair those that could be made serviceable again. %N%N Although this ship will require further expenditure to make it combat worthy, her addition to the Italian fleet will increase your ability to threaten Allied shipping in the Mediterranean.
<<TAG_313>>= Commander in Chief %N%N To assist our campaign against the Greeks, we could attempt to bribe some Greek politicians and army officers so that they spread defeatist propaganda and calls for surrender within Greece. %N%N Success is not guaranteed, but it will only cost us 15 MPPs and it could cause some disruption to Greece's armed forces, so it may be worthwhile. %N%N Would you like to authorize this expenditure on bribes to Greek politicians and military figures?
<<TAG_314>>= Bribes Paid To High Ranking Greeks
<<TAG_315>>= Mussolini believed that he could bring about a Greek surrender through the large scale bribery of Greece's politicians and generals. %N%N Whether or not any money will reach the intended recipients is uncertain, so saying (YES) to bribing the Greeks has only a 30% chance of success. %N%N If successful, then Greek forces will suffer a morale reduction which will reduce their combat effectiveness, making the country slightly easier to conquer.
<<TAG_316>>= Office of the Navy %NAdmiral Cavagnari %N%N For a modest investment we could strike at Allied naval units in port using a new innovation, the human torpedo. %N%N Preparing a submarine for this role will only cost us 25 MPPs, and while each of its attacks will only have a very small chance of success, the damage that could be inflicted if even one attempt were successful could make it well worth the cost. %N%N Would you like to authorize this expenditure so that we can launch human torpedo attacks against shipping in enemy ports?
<<TAG_317>>= Prince Borghese's Human Torpedoes
<<TAG_318>>= Prince Junio Borghese's submarine within the 1st Flottiglia Mezzi d'Assalto (1st MAS) was used to transport manned torpedoes to carry out close range attacks on enemy shipping in harbours throughout the Mediterranean. %N%N If you say (YES), then there will be a 2% chance per turn of a successful human torpedo attack on Allied ships in the harbours of: %N- Alexandria %N- Algiers %N- Benghazi %N- Gibraltar %N- Malta %N- Port Said %N- Tobruk %N- Tripoli %N- Tunis. %N%N The chance for attacks to occur will continue for as long as Italy remains in the war on the Axis side, and if successful, Allied naval units within the targeted ports could suffer serious damage.
<<TAG_319>>= Ammiraglio di Squadra %N%N Say (YES) if you would you like our ships to continue sailing through the Gibraltar Strait to the Atlantic. %N%N If not, then say (NO) and they will remain in their current position.
<<TAG_320>>= Ammiraglio di Squadra %N%N Say (YES) if you would you like our ships to continue sailing through the Gibraltar Strait to the Mediterranean. %N%N If not, then say (NO) and they will remain in their current position.
<<TAG_321>>= Commander in Chief %N%N The time has come for us to assert ourselves further in the Balkans, to win fame and glory for Italy, lest Germany takes all the glory for itself. %N%N If you say (YES), then we will deploy two half strength Corps in Albania, and we will declare war on Greece at the end of October. %N%N Rushing these forces to Albania and deploying them there will cost us 100 MPPs, at 50 MPPs a turn for 2 turns. %N%N Would you like to authorize this expenditure and declare war on Greece at the end of this month?
<<TAG_322>>= Preparations For War Against Greece
<<TAG_323>>= Mussolini was annoyed that he wasn't informed of Germany's actions before they took place. So he decided to go to war against Greece without informing his German allies first. %N%N Troops had to be rushed to Albania but even so, the Greeks fought bravely and advanced into Albania, much to Mussolini's embarrassment. %N%N By saying (YES) to this, Italian National Morale will increase by 500 points. %N%N However, if Allied forces do enter Albania then Italian National Morale will fall by 1,500 points, and if Tirana is lost then it will fall a further 5,000 points.
<<TAG_324>>= The Volkssturm alone will not be able to stem the tide of the enemy's advance, but they will be more useful if we invest in their training and equipment, so it is recommended to say (YES) to this.
