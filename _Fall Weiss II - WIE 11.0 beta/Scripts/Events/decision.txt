;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;
; USAGE:
;
; Basic structure for a decision event:
; {
; #NAME= Event name (this will be shown as a selectable event under an OPTIONS screen within the game)
; #POPUP= Event popup text (this will be displayed when the event occurs)
; #IMAGE= Event image that will be displayed when event occurs
;         PNG images must be 736x418 or 368x418 pixels, see 'Extras' folder for sample images and frames
;         Multiple pictures can be used by using a ',' to separate them
;         Format: picture1.png, picture2.png, picture3.png, picture4.png
; #SOUND= Event sound that will be displayed when event occurs
;         Multiple sounds can be used by using a ',' to separate them
;         Format: sound1.mp3, sound2.mp3, sound3.mp3, sound4.mp3
; #FLAG= Will this be a default event for the campaign? (values range [0, 1]; True= 1; False= 0)
; #TYPE= Values range [0, 3];
;        With all other fields satisfied will this be:
;        0 = Single check regardless if #TRIGGER is satisfied
;        1 = Multiple check until #TRIGGER is satisfied
;        2 = Reoccurring check until end of game
;                       OR
;        Once the #DATE field is satisfied:
;        3 = Event fires once if all other fields are satisfied, else it will not fire.  Either way, event will be removed never to be looked at again
; #AI= Values range [0, 6]
;      0 = Event fires whenever all fields are satisfied for any game type
;      1 = Event fires whenever all fields are satisfied, for Single Player games only, and only when the AI is Axis
;      2 = Event fires whenever all fields are satisfied, for Single Player games only, and only when the AI is Allied
;      3 = Event fires whenever all fields are satisfied, for any game type, and only when the AI is Axis in Single Player, or on Allied Multiplayer turns
;      4 = Event fires whenever all fields are satisfied, for any game type, and only when the AI is Allied in Single Player or on Axis Multiplayer turns
;      5 = Event fires whenever all fields are satisfied, for Single Player games only, and only when the AI is Axis in Single Player, 
;          or for AI controlled Axis majors on Axis human player turns
;      6 = Event fires whenever all fields are satisfied, for Single Player games only, and only when the AI is Allied in Single Player,
;          or for AI controlled Allied majors on Allied human player turns
; #LEVEL= Value range [-1, 4]
;      What minimum skill level, as selected from the AI difficulty level screen in game, with this event apply to?
;     -1 = a script that should only fire for AI friendly controlled majors on your turn

;      2 = Intermediate
;      3 = Veteran
;      4 = Expert
; #GV= Does the event activate based on the Global Variable values assigned?
;      Ten random Global Variables are assigned at the start of the campaign each with a value between [1,100]
;      Format: GV [min, max]; GV range [1,10]; min range [1,100]; max range [1,100]
;      Example A) #GV= 1[1,100] will always trigger because Global Variable #1 will always have a value between [1,100]
;      Example B) #GV= 4[71,100] will trigger 30% per game
; #LINK= Does the event activate based on the Link values assigned?
;        A campaign can have up to 1100 Decision events and is referenced by other events via this parameter
;        Format: decision[flag]; flag range [0, 1]; True= 1; False= 0
;        Example A) #LINK= 0[0] will always trigger as formal DECISION events can only be from 1-1100
;        Example B) #LINK= 1[0] will trigger whenever #DECISION= 1 is not accepted
;        Example C) #LINK= 3[1] will trigger whenever #DECISION= 3 is accepted
; #TRIGGER= Trigger percentage that the event will occur (values range [0, 100])
; #COUNTRY_ID= Country ID that will be owner of this event
; #DISPLAY_ORDER= Value range [0, 1]
;        When do we display this event?

;        1 = Beginning of Turn
; #DECISION= Value range [1, 1100] What internal decision number is this event assigned to? max of 1100 decisions per campaign)
; #MPP_UPDOWN= Will there be an associated MPPs amount added or subtracted with respect to #COUNTRY_ID for this decision if yes? (values range [-9999, 9999])
; #MPP_TURNS= Value range [0, 500] How many turns will the #MPP_UPDOWN= value be added or subtracted for?
; #MPP_TEXT= What text will be shown in the MPPs collection dialog for this event if the #MPP_UPDOWN value is set?
; #AI_RESPONSE= What percentage chance will the AI respond 'Yes'  event? (values range [0, 100])
; #AI_RESPONSE_POPUP= What is the AI response popup? Note, this popup is also used in the previous turn summary list
; #NOTES= Text to display if the player clicks on the NOTES button in the DECISION screen
; #NOTES_POSITION= What position should we center the map on if the player clicks on the NOTES button (entry can be left blank)
; #DATE= Date that must be satisfied (in game) for event to occur (format yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy/mm/dd [=]).
;        if [=] is used, only apply for year specified.
; #TEXT_RGB= Text color for the decision event
;            Format: red, green, blue (values range [0, 255])
; #SHADOW_RGB= Shadow color for the decision event text (NOT USED IN SC3)
;              Format: red, green, blue (values range [0, 255])
; #ALIGNMENT_POSITION= Position that must be under the control of the selected side in order for the event to occur
;                      Format: x,y; political_alignment [values are 0, 1 or 2]
; #NATIONAL_MORALE_TRIGGER= Under what national morale situation will this event occur
;                           Format: country_id [national_morale_percentage]
; #VARIABLE_CONDITION= Under what variable conditions will this event occur
;                      Format: country_id [political_alignment] [mobilization%] [surrendered_flag]
; #CONDITION_POSITION= Map positions that will serve to trigger the event as well as distance and
;                      number of Axis/Allied unit ranges as specified by 'alignment' flag
;                      Format: x,y [min_range, max_range] [min_units, max_units] [alignment] [aligned_country_id]
; 
; NOTES:
;
; Each event must be preceded by a '{' and end with a '}'
;
; Use the reference values provided for #COUNTRY_ID and not the country names
;
; #ALIGNMENT_POSITION - Can refer to either land or a coastal hexes. More than one position can be set.
; Each #ALIGNMENT_POSITION will be read with AND logic.
;
; More than one #NATIONAL_MORALE_TRIGGER can be set and the event checks for a value less than or 
; equal to the 'national_morale_percentage'.
; Each #NATIONAL_MORALE_TRIGGER line will be read using AND logic.
;
; Under #VARIABLE_CONDITION you can also list countries that have not yet fully entered the war.
; For example by listing an mobilization % less than 100% you are providing a check where the
; #VARIABLE_CONDITION country must meet a minimum mobilization % in order for the event to occur.
; Each #VARIABLE_CONDITION line will be read using AND logic.
;
; More than one #CONDITION_POSITION can be set. Distance or range checks will be based on the 
; specified x,y position. For example if the x,y position is a coastal hex then range checks will
; be made on sea hexes, otherwise if it is a land hex range checks will be made on land hexes only.
; If the 'aligned_country_id' flag is set to 0 then it will check for any Axis or Allied country as
; determined by the alignment flag.
; Each #CONDITION_POSITION line will be read using OR logic.

#NOTES= If you say %B(YES), then our convoy routes from Canada, the USA, the Middle East and Mediterranean will adopt new and safer routes, though we will receive less income from them. %N%N Our convoys that currently cross the Mediterranean would now circumvent the Cape Of Good Hope and arrive in Liverpool, while those from North America would shift upwards nearer Iceland and through the North Atlantic. %N%N If you say %B(NO), then our convoys will maintain their current routes and income values, but they will run a greater risk of disruption than if we had altered their routes. %N%N If you say %B(NO) and Malta or Gibraltar are later occupied by the Axis, then there will be a 33% chance per turn of Egypt's convoy ceasing to sail through the Mediterranean. It would then switch to using the longer but safer route to the UK via the Cape of Good Hope. So there may be a delay before this happens.

#POPUP=
#MESSAGE= Office Of The British Foreign Secretary %N Anthony Eden %N%N The Prime Minister is pressing once again for us to occupy an Irish port. This time he recommends the port of Limerick on the west coast of Ireland. %N%N It is certainly true that using this port could be very useful, but doing so would also cause a strong reaction in Ireland against us. Unlike with the Treaty ports, we have had no claim whatsoever  port since the civil war ended in 1921. %N%N Occupying Limerick will only cost us 25 MPPs, though it will trigger a reaction against us in both Ireland and the USA. %N%N This port could be of significant use, and our bold and decisive action would improve our National Morale by 1,000 points. %N%N Would you like to order the Royal Navy to occupy the port of Limerick %B(YES)?

He therefore asks permission to form the Polish I Corps on our soil. %N%N It will cost us 50 MPPs, at 25 MPPs for 2 turns, and this new Polish Corps will be formed at Le Mans to the south west of Paris. %N%N Would you like to give permission to the formation of the Polish I Corps?

Originally planned for the invasion of France, the railway gun is currently on schedule to be deployed in February 1942.  %N%N There remains the possibility that we can expedite the design work and have Schwerer Gustav battle ready for August 1941, however doing so will forgo further trials and surely reduce the Railway Gun's initial effectiveness. %N%N Mein Führer, we await your orders, should we expedite the construction of Schwerer Gustav?

Should we continue with the construction of Tirpitz %B(YES) or should we focus our efforts on building more U-boats to support unrestricted submarine warfare? %B(NO) It will cost 15 MPPs for 2 turns to scrap construction of Tirpitz and switch our resources to the construction of additional U-boats.

The Vichy French are not well equipped however, so the Vichy French will require supplies from Germany if they are to declare for the Axis.  %N%N It should be noted that Mussolini is not aware of the secret negotiations and will be undoubtedly furious if Italy will be asked to fight along side of the French.

However, the Finnish government refused, because Finland saw its war as a "separate war" from the Second World War, and it saw its objectives as different from those of Germany.  %N%N Signing the Tripartite Pact and declaring war on the Allies could result in some civil unrest in Finland.  By selecting %B(YES), Finland's National Morale will immediately drop 1,000 points and there will also be a 5% chance per turn that mass demonstrations will disrupt supply in Helsinki.  However by selecting %B(YES) Finland will also receive a full strength Tank Division near Helsinki and will be eligible to receive a higher percentage of German military aid by convoy for the remainder of the war. %N%N If you select %B(NO), Finland will still be eligible to receive resources from Germany by convoy, albeit with lower maximum tonnage.

#MESSAGE= Führerhauptquartier %N%N Operation Sealion %N%N Mein Führer, OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl has formally presented his plan for an invasion of Britain, which if successful will ensure victory in Western Europe.  If we consider proceeding then preliminary planning should commence immediately, if it has not already.  The Kriegsmarine, which will support our landing craft can not match the warships of the Royal Navy, so it is imperative that the Luftwaffe gain air superiority.  Once we gain air superiority we must then risk crossing the English Channel. To support an invasion of Britain the delivery of every available assault boat, landing craft and paratrooper should be prioritized.  %N%N We must note that opposition to the planned invasion of Britain, codenamed Operation Sealion is very vocal amongst senior staff. With the risk of eventual Soviet intervention while we are at war on British soil, our military resources may become over stretched as we wage war on multiple fronts. Rather then hastily support our amphibious capabilities we could instead focus our military resources on strengthening the Wehrmacht for an eventual war on the Eastern Front. %N%N Mein Führer, should we hastily prepare our amphibious capabilities or continue to strengthen the general Wehrmacht with our available resources?

#NOTES= %N%N Historically, Führer Directive No. 16 set in motion preparations for the invasion of Britain, but the amphibious invasion never materialized.  While the Luftwaffe were confident that a decisive result could be achieved, the Kriegsmarine were not. The invasion was eventually put on indefinite hold as detailed plans to attack the Soviet Union took precedence.  %N%N Ultimately, this is a significant opportunity to direct our military resources to support long term German strategic aims no matter what our immediate plans may be.  If you select %B(YES), Germany will immediately deploy at half strength a Special Forces and Paratrooper unit at Cologne, and Motor Boat Torpedo units in the ports of Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven.  %N%N If you select %B(NO), Germany will receive a full strength HQ and Tank Corps at Berlin in December 1940.

#MESSAGE= Führerhauptquartier %N%N German-Soviet Border And Commercial Agreement %N%N Mein Führer, the German ambassador to Moscow von Schulenburg and Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov are prepared to sign agreements to settle all open Soviet disputes.  While signing will not significantly improve our existing economic agreement with the Soviets, it should serve to disguise our continuing plans for an invasion of USSR.  %N%N The Soviets continue to demand samples of Germany's latest war planes, artillery, explosives and other military equipment, which we will have to provide.  The downside of signing the German-Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement is that the Soviet's will benefit from our technology, but Stalin will continue to see Germany as an economic ally and reduce the Soviets war readiness. %N%N Mein Führer, should we order Schulenburg to sign the agreement in Moscow, or should we continue to delay the delivery of military goods to USSR?

#MESSAGE= Middle East Command to 10 Downing Street %N%N With the our recent victory over the Italians in Ethiopia, we must now decide whether to transfer a portion of our forces from the region to instead strengthen our position in Egypt. %N%N These forces have battled sickness and Malaria throughout the Italian East African campaign and will require considerable equipment and other necessities before being deployed in Egypt, or they could remain in East Africa and assist to defeat the remaining Italians, which would require less effort. %N%N With consideration of how stretched our current military resources may be, we may want to consider allowing these forces to temporarily remain in East Africa.  However should war break out in other regions these forces could end up deployed to another theater altogether.  %N%N In light of these considerations should we re-deploy some of our forces from East Africa to Egypt to serve under Middle East Command %B(YES) or leave these forces in East Africa, knowing that they may be sent to other theaters as the war unfolds %B(NO).  It will cost 125 MPPs for 2 turns to re-deploy the units to Egypt.

These newer tanks however, continued to roll off the production line in vast numbers to the German detriment.  %N%N If you select %B(YES), USSR will deploy a fully upgraded Tank Corps and a Tank Division as well as a half strength HQ at Smolensk.  If you select %B(NO), USSR will deploy a fully upgraded Tank Corps and a Tank Division as well as a half strength HQ at Kiev.  %N%N Irrespective of your decision, a 2nd fully upgraded Tank Corps will also deploy at Moscow later this year.  Each of these Tank units will arrive with +2 experience to represent the technical superiority of the newest Soviet designed Tanks during the initial phase of operation Barbarossa.

#MESSAGE= Prime Minister %N Winston Churchill %N%N Operation Sledgehammer or Operation Overlord %N%N As the USSR fights the German Army along the Eastern Front, Stalin has urged the Western Allies to open a second front in France. We agree that if successful a cross channel invasion of occupied France could lead to a decisive victory against the Axis.  %N%N To prepare for this full scale invasion the Western Allies have set forth in motion specialized training in landing craft, amphibious warfare, airborne forces and aerial bombing.  It is imperative to have built our strength so that we not only secure beachheads but also drive the Germans out of France entirely.  effect we have devised two different proposed dates for the invasion named Operation Sledgehammer and Operation Overlord.  Operation Sledgehammer is a proposed cross channel invasion to commence in 1943, and Operation Overlord to commence in 1944. %N%N Should we hastily prepare our forces for Operation Sledgehammer %B(YES), or continue our preparations for Operation Overlord, which is favoured amongst our other Western Allies %B(NO)? It will cost the USA 100 MPPs for 3 turns and UK 75 MPPs for 3 turns to rush the plans for Operation Sledgehammer.

Through this investment we will avoid suffering unduly from sicknesses during the upcoming winter. %N%N Would you like to prepare the Army to fight more effectively during the upcoming winter?

During the Battle of France, German aircraft violated Swiss airspace hundreds of times and in several incidents German aircraft were shot-down.  Germany protested diplomatically multiple times in June 1940, which Hitler himself followed up that Germany would respond in another manner if the practice continued.  In response Switzerland ordered the air force to stop intercepting German aircraft and instead forced intruding aircraft to land at Swiss airfields.%N%N If you select %B(YES), and threaten Switzerland, the country will move 2-5% closer to the Allies in response to the German ultimatum.  %N%N If you select %B(NO), Switzerland will continue to intercept and shoot down German aircraft in violation of its airspace and German national morale will decrease by 750 points as a result.

#MESSAGE= Prime Minister %N Winston Churchill %N%N The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Lord Craigavon, is urging the use of Scottish and Welsh troops to overrun Southern Ireland and to install a Governor-General over the entire island.  Political tensions between Southern and Northern Ireland have reached a climax, and could lead to an eventual conflict that will distract from the war with Germany.  %N%N An occupation of Southern Ireland will boost our income and is not expected to be a dangerous military operation, however, it will prove an unfavorable move politically, causing unnecessary unrest which will lower our National Morale and will also be viewed unfavorably by the USA. %N%N In light of these considerations should we order the occupation of Southern Ireland %B(YES)?  It will cost 50 MPPs for 4 turns.

#POPUP=
#MESSAGE= Führerhauptquartier %N%N While we battle along the Eastern Front we are forced to consider the defense of France should the Allies successfully open up a second front in the West.%N%N It is therefore paramount that we strengthen our mainland defenses by transferring forces from the Eastern Front to ward off any Allied invasion plans or to push them back into the sea.%N%N There is ongoing debate within High Command whether these reserve units should be consolidated into stronger centralized units ready to smash the Allies as they advance inland or should they be spread out to cover a wider defensive area.  These units could prove crucial in repelling any invasion and positioning of these reserves should be considered carefully. %N%N Their construction will cost 800 MPPs, at 100 MPPs a turn for 8 turns. %N%N Would you like to consolidate these reserves or spread them out further across France?

These units will initially deploy at Paris and are unlikely to repel an Allied invasion but could slow down the Allies long enough for the regular German Army to counter attack. %N%N Forming these Ostbataillonen units in France will cost 25 MPPs for 3 turns if you select %B(YES)

Osttruppen were frequently stationed away from front lines and used for coastal defense or rear-area activities, such as security operations, thus freeing up regular German forces for front-line service. %N%N This is cheap and effective way to increase our garrisons in France against the Allies.%N%N If you select %B(YES), Germany will deploy 2 Infantry Divisions and an Anti-Air unit at Paris.
