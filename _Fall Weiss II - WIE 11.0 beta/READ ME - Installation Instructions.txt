Installation Instructions:

Unzip the folder that was downloaded from Dropbox to the following location, note that "My Profile" will be custom to your computer:

C:Drive > Users > My Profile > Documents > MY Games > SC3 > Campaigns

Possible Trouble shoots:

1) If you can not locate the above "Campaign folder" then open the game editor, create a new campaign and save it with a unique name.  Then search your computer for the campaign, and you will have located the "campaign folder" to which the mod can be extracted to.
2) If the mod is not showing up when launching the game and you have the campaign in the correct folder, try opening the mod in the editor and saving.
