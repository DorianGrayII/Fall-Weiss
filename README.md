# Fall-Weiss-II

I take no credit for the original work contained in the Fall Weiss II (June 2023), Strategic Command, War In Europe custom campaign.

The original purpose this repo was solely to facilitate managing changes to the Event and AI scripts in order to address the overwhelming number of grammar, punctuation, event message formatting issues encountered.

However, it has subsequently evolved to also include:

    - managing changes to the scenario core data contained in "Fall Weiss II - WIE 11.0 beta.cgn"
    - merging / incorporating fixes from the "1939 Storm Across Europe (July 2023) baseline scenario"
    - as well as any other localized fixes and enhancements that have been implemented
